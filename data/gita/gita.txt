[GITA:261] FOREWORD
[GITA:263] The Bhagavad Gita, in spite of being an episode in The Mahabharata,
[GITA:264] has more to it. The Mahabharata, which is said to date back to 5000 B.C., is
[GITA:265] still adored and read, not only for its being an epic of enormous proportions
[GITA:266] but also because it is a tale reflecting the man of all times. If one fee ls that
[GITA:267] it is a fictitious story, it has all that a masterpiece demands. If it is
[GITA:268] considered something beyond and a real tale, it evidences the existence of
[GITA:269] superior human beings.  All the characters in the epic  were highly learned
[GITA:270] and were disciples of Gur u Drona, according to the story. They were all
[GITA:271] human beings, despite the fact that they had the personal interference of
[GITA:272] God himself in their lives.
[GITA:273] This story is an example of the weaknesses that human beings are
[GITA:274] subject to. Arjuna’s doubts in the Bhagava d Gita are the doubts of every
[GITA:275] man. Like when we are in the line of duty, we are often pulled by fears,
[GITA:276] doubts, jealousies, weaknesses, nepotism, etc. Arjuna too was vexed of war
[GITA:277] by his excessive love, respect, and devotion for his elders, relatives, and
[GITA:278] friends whom he had to fight against.
[GITA:279] Here, Arjuna says that he was ‘Nara’ in every respect. He was a bundle
[GITA:280] of human weaknesses, despite being physically strong. Krishna’s sermon to
[GITA:281] Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita was an attempt to uplift him from his mental
[GITA:282] discrepancy. In other words, it is a great treatise on ‘personality
[GITA:283] development’, a modern buzz word. All the planes of the human mind find
[GITA:284] mention here. It seeks to address all the ills of man, be they physical,
[GITA:285] psychological, spiritual, or whatever.
[GITA:286] And Arjuna here appears to be a studious disciple, with his coming out
[GITA:287] with a great many questions, which rather tickle every learned mind. The
[GITA:288] occasion here was that the Bhagwan himself was the fount of the sermon.
[GITA:289] Hence Arjuna, the archer that he was here fo r the moment, was aiming
[GITA:290] arrows of questions, and those questions were turning out to be real sources
[GITA:291] of light for all mankind, by the divine grace of Bhagwan Krishna. Arjuna,
[GITA:292] in fact, had received instructions from Guru Drona and could never be in
[GITA:293] need of  an elaborate instruction. It was only a momentary delusion for
[GITA:305] xjkhh
[GITA:307] Arjuna, and Krishna arranged that pretext as the stage for giving him the
[GITA:308] sermon of the ‘Bhagavad Gita’. Such human weaknesses are all we are
[GITA:309] prone to. Hence, ‘Bhagavad Gita’ is for all of us.
[GITA:310] Arjuna was sermonised by Lord Krishna in the middle of the battle. It
[GITA:311] was one such occasion where sometimes even great and illumined souls
[GITA:312] could turn ignorant and weak. The Bhagavad Gita’ was an attempt to alert
[GITA:313] Arjuna to human acts on a big stage like th e Kurukshetra battle. It was like
[GITA:314] learning while doing or like a good lesson that we usually learn at the
[GITA:315] height of misery and peril. No wonder that the Bhagavad Gita is a
[GITA:316] prescribed text in India and elsewhere for students.
[GITA:317] Several attempts have been made  at various times to explain the spirit
[GITA:318] of the Gita to man. This one attempt by Dr.Giridhar Boray is born out of
[GITA:319] his intention to bring the ‘ Bhagavad Gita’ to the attention of the present
[GITA:320] day younger generation. It is strengthened in the light of its takin g
[GITA:321] inspiration from the Gita Vivruti  by HH Sri Raghavendra Teertha and
[GITA:322] lectures by HH Sri Vidya Sagara Madhava Teertha Swamiji, head of the Sri
[GITA:323] Madhava Teertha Pontificate and Sree Sameerachar of Tambihalli Math.
[GITA:324] The book makes understanding the concepts ea sier by providing a
[GITA:325] summary of all the chapters at the beginning as well as at the end of each
[GITA:326] verse. The book is really a diligent effort offered at the lotus feet of Lord
[GITA:327] Sri Venkateswara in all humility. A complete study of the whole book
[GITA:328] without deleti ng any subtitle is bound to bring to the common man the
[GITA:329] required spiritual knowledge and also immense satisfaction.

[GITA:368] Guru Vandana – Obeisance to the Teacher
[GITA:370] I offer my respectful obeisance to His Holiness Sri Vidyasagara
[GITA:371] Madhava Teertha Swamiji, pontiff of Sr i Madhava  Teertha Pontificate in
[GITA:372] Karnataka, India. His Holiness is the 25 th pontiff in the lineage of Sri
[GITA:373] Madhava Teertha, the 14th century ascetic and philosopher who was a direct
[GITA:374] disciple of Sri Madhwacharya, the exponent of the Dvaita ( theistic dualism)
[GITA:375] school of Indian philosophy.  Vishnu Shastri, a great scholar in the Ad vaita
[GITA:376] (theistic monism) school of philosophy of the 13th century came in contact
[GITA:377] with Sri Madhwacharya , who was reviving the theistic dualism philosophy
[GITA:378] built on the fundamental premise  of a clear difference between the
[GITA:379] individual soul and the Lord Almighty (the Supreme Soul). Vishnu Shastri
[GITA:380] was greatly influenced by the divine, scholarly arguments of Sri
[GITA:381] Madhwacharya and in particular by his commentary on 40 selected hymns
[GITA:382] of the Rig Veda.  He became a disciple of Sri Madhwacharya and entered
[GITA:383] the monastery as Sri Madhava Teertha . He headed the Madhwa Pontificate
[GITA:384] in the 14th century. He is credited to be the only scholar to have composed a
[GITA:385] rigorous commentary on all the four Vedas based o n the concepts of the
[GITA:386] Dvaita philosophy. He was blessed and gifted with the beautiful idol of
[GITA:387] Lord Sri Veera Rama by Sri Madhwacharya , and this idol continues to be
[GITA:388] worshipped to this day by the reigning pontiff.
[GITA:390] The reigning pontiff HH Sri Vidyasagara M adhava Teertha was born
[GITA:391] on the most auspicious Ananta Chaturdashi  day of 1932 to very pious
[GITA:392] parents, in the illustrious lineage of HH Sri Kambaluru Ramachandra
[GITA:393] Teertha of the glorious Sri Vyasaraja Math . He was named Venkatesha. He
[GITA:394] was groomed into every a spect of Sri Madhwa ’s philosophy from his
[GITA:395] childhood days by his father who was also a great scholar. He had a
[GITA:396] brilliant academic record, securing a master’s degree in Literature followed
[GITA:397] by a Doctorate in the Mahabharata from Karnataka University . He c hose
[GITA:398] teaching as his career and served as Professor  and Principal of Government
[GITA:399] Arts College in the state of Andhra Pradesh.
[GITA:412] xiii
[GITA:417] After retiring from active service, he was invited to be the Principal
[GITA:418] of Sri Guru Sarvabhowma Samskruta Vidyapeeta at Mantralayam whe re he
[GITA:419] served at the divine feet of Sri Raghavendra Swamy. Pleased by his service,
[GITA:420] within a year, Sri Raghavendra Swamy chose him to  lead the pontificate of
[GITA:421] Sri Madhava Teertha Moola Samsthana mat h, resulting in an invitation to
[GITA:422] him by the then pontiff Sri Prasanna Shoora Madhavateertha . He  was
[GITA:423] named Sri Vidyasagara Madhavateertha, and he has been serving the
[GITA:424] pontificate for over 19 years performing daily worship to the most sacred
[GITA:425] Sri Veera Rama idol with great devotion and dedication. An erudite scholar
[GITA:426] with proficiency in many aspects of literature, arts, and mastery over many
[GITA:427] languages, HH has composed many devotional songs in Kannada which
[GITA:428] bring out his emotional relationship with the Lord Almighty. HH observes
[GITA:429] strict austerities for ascetics as laid dow n by Sri Madhwacharya and is an
[GITA:430] ideal seer in every sense. Under his stewardship the pontificate has  made
[GITA:431] great strides and attracted many loyal, committed followers.
[GITA:433] Due to divine providence, I got the opportunity to attend the daily
[GITA:434] lectures conducted by His Holiness on Gita Vivruti - a commentary on the
[GITA:435] Bhagavad Gita  by the 16 th century ascetic and philosopher Sri
[GITA:436] Raghavendra Teertha , which is based on the commentary by Sri
[GITA:437] Madhwacharya and Sri Jaya Teertha.  HH graciously supported and blessed
[GITA:438] my effort  (a feeble though!) to capture in English, the essence of Sri
[GITA:439] Raghavendra Teertha’s Gita Vivruti  and his lectures which were in
[GITA:440] Kannada, to benefit a larger audience. I respectfully offer this work to His
[GITA:441] Holiness as Guru Dakshina and seek his blessings.

[GITA:585] Introduction - Background and Battleground
[GITA:587] Over centuries, the Bhagavad Gita  has been considered an
[GITA:588] important spiritual guidebook and has influenced many thought leaders in
[GITA:589] human history. T he Gita is a conversational poe m and is part of the great
[GITA:590] Indian epic the Mahabharata, which is a story about the families of two
[GITA:591] brothers who inherit a kingdom from their father. These cousins are known
[GITA:592] as the ‘Pandavas’ and the ‘Kauravas’. The Kaurava brothers are 100 in
[GITA:593] number and the Pandavas are 5. The Kauravas, no t wanting to share the
[GITA:594] kingdom with their cousins , invite them to a game of d ice. They use
[GITA:595] dubious means to defeat the Pandavas and annex their kingdom after
[GITA:596] winning the wager. As per the rules of the wager, the Pandavas complete
[GITA:597] their stay outside the kin gdom and come back to ask for their fair share of
[GITA:598] the kingdom so that they can rule with dignity. The Kauravas refuse to
[GITA:599] honor the agreement and even deny the Pandavas a settlement of 5 villages
[GITA:600] so that they can live in peace. As the Kau ravas refuse to bud ge even an
[GITA:601] inch, the Pandavas have no choice but to declare war on them to get back
[GITA:602] their share of the kingdom. During this period, The Lord who ha s
[GITA:603] incarnated as Krishna offers the cousins a choice between His army and
[GITA:604] Himself. But He makes it clear that He Himself would not be participating
[GITA:605] in the war. The Kauravas choose His army as Krishna would not be
[GITA:606] fighting, and the Pandavas are happy to just have Krishna on their side.
[GITA:607] Krishna takes on the role of charioteer to Arjuna’s chariot (Arjuna is the
[GITA:608] third brother among the five Pandavas).
[GITA:610] Before the war starts, the two armies assemble on the battlefield,
[GITA:611] facing each other. At this point, Arjuna requests Krishna to place his
[GITA:612] chariot in the middle so that he can get a full view of the warring forces.
[GITA:613] Since this is a war between cousins, Arjuna sees  his cousins, uncles,
[GITA:614] grandfathers, great grandfathers, nephews, friends, classmates etc. on both
[GITA:615] sides. He is overcome with emotion and grief at the prospect of bloodshed
[GITA:616] among his family and friends for the sak e of a kingdom.  He declares his
[GITA:617] intention to renounce the war and let the Kauravas keep the kingdom, thus
[GITA:629] 2                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:630] abdicating his responsibility as a prince and a warrior. It is at this stage that
[GITA:631] Krishna teaches him the Gita which is structured as a series of ques tions
[GITA:632] from Arjuna and answers  from Krishna.  Krishna extols  the virtue  of
[GITA:633] performing one’s duties regardless of the outcome , and not avoiding
[GITA:634] prescribed duties which may be  difficult and unpleasant. As Krishna starts
[GITA:635] to talk to Arjuna on the virtues of doin g one’s work (in this case Arjuna
[GITA:636] needing to fight a rightful war), Arjuna asks a series of questions on the
[GITA:637] bigger issues of life, individual souls, the Lord Almighty, the universe, the
[GITA:638] circle of life etc., for which Krishna provide s clear, unambiguous an swers.
[GITA:639] He finally convinces Arjuna that his fears were unfound ed and that he
[GITA:640] should fight to free the Kingdom from the Kauravas and provide a just and
[GITA:641] compassionate administration to his citizens.
[GITA:643] At first a battleground is hardly the place for someone to  be
[GITA:644] preaching philosophy.  However, many of the questions that we have in life
[GITA:645] are about the choices we have to make, especially in challenging times. It is
[GITA:646] interesting to note that Sanskrit verses lend themselves to multiple
[GITA:647] meanings and in one interpreta tion, the battleground in the Gita is
[GITA:648] compared to the human body (and mind), and the battle between the
[GITA:649] Pandavas and the Kauravas is compared to the constant strife between good
[GITA:650] and evil thoughts that we encounter daily. The Gita is indeed a teaching for
[GITA:651] all of us , with Arjuna acting as an example of an individual at crossroads,
[GITA:652] desperately looking for guidance and support.
[GITA:654] The Gita is one of the most widely read and commented upon
[GITA:655] spiritual works in human history. There are several excellent books on it in
[GITA:656] various languages. Given that the original work is in Sanskrit, most of the
[GITA:657] scholarly commentaries have been in Sanskrit or other Indian languages
[GITA:658] which are closer to Sanskrit. To read and comprehend many of them, one
[GITA:659] would need some training in Indian s piritual studies , as many of them
[GITA:660] liberally use Sanskrit words albeit transliterated in English. It was felt that
[GITA:661] there is a need to present the key concepts of The Gita in plain English for
[GITA:662] everyday folk , minimizing the use of  Sanskrit words. These observ ations
[GITA:663] led to the development of this manuscript.
[GITA:675] Introduction                                                                                                                                              3
[GITA:678] While there are many learned commentaries on the Gita written over
[GITA:679] the centuries, this author has been greatly influenced by the authoritative
[GITA:680] commentary and lucid explanations of difficult concepts by Sr i
[GITA:681] Madhwacharya, the 12th century ascetic who propounded the philosophy of
[GITA:682] dualistic theism (concept of difference between the almighty Lord and
[GITA:683] individual souls at all times and places). Sri Madhwacharya’s commentary
[GITA:684] has been further elaborated and summari zed by later day savants such as
[GITA:685] Sri Padmanabha Teertha (13 th Century), Sri Jaya Teertha (13th Century) Sri
[GITA:686] Vadiraja Teertha (16 th Century), Sri Raghavendra Teertha (17th century)
[GITA:687] and others.
[GITA:689] The Gita consists of 18 chapters with a total of 70 11 verses in
[GITA:690] Sanskrit. The Gita is part of the great Hindu epic The Mahabharata and
[GITA:691] appears as Chapters 25 to 42, in the Book of Bheeshma in the
[GITA:692] Mahabharata. Most of the verses appear in the anushtap meter, where
[GITA:693] each verse has a total of 32 letters  with 8 words in e ach of the four
[GITA:694] quadrants. Some verses in the 15 th chapter appear in trishtup meter with 44
[GITA:695] words. As per Sri Raghavendra Teertha [GV], t he 18 chapters can be
[GITA:696] broadly classified into 3 sections with 6 chapters in each section. The first
[GITA:697] section with chapters 1-6 (280 verses) broadly outlines how one can  obtain
[GITA:698] divine, spiritual knowledge (jnana upaya), the second section with chapters
[GITA:699] 7-12 (209 verses) focuses on devotion and divine, spiritual knowledge
[GITA:700] (vijnana) that leads one to liberation , and the third  section consisting of
[GITA:701] chapters 13 -18 (212 verses) elaborates on the concepts in the first two
[GITA:702] sections. It is also believed that the Gita conveys at least 10 different
[GITA:703] meanings, all of which are consistent with one another. An illustration of
[GITA:704] multiple meanings in the Gita will appear in Chapter 2.  It is also said that
[GITA:705] the Gita has 3 major interpretations – historical, psychological, and
[GITA:706] spiritual.
[GITA:710] 1 Some texts of Gita indicate a total of 700 verses (omitting the first verse attributed to Arjuna in Chapter
[GITA:711] 13)
[GITA:723] 4                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:724] The Gita and the Number 18
[GITA:726] Numbers and numerology play an incredibly significant  role in
[GITA:727] Indian theology. In fact, the study of knowledge is termed ‘ Sankhya Yoga’,
[GITA:728] with Sankhya meaning ‘arithmetic’. The world around us is based on
[GITA:729] numbers. We are constantly measuring, managing, quantifying all our
[GITA:730] activities with the aid of numbers. We wake up at a certain tim e, we
[GITA:731] work/study for certain hours, we travel a certain distance, we consume
[GITA:732] some amount of food, we transact with certain currency, we perform
[GITA:733] activities at a certain time, on a certain day, in a certain month, in a certain
[GITA:734] year etc. And all these numbers  and calculations are based on the position
[GITA:735] and movement of celestial objects such as the Sun, Moon, stars etc.
[GITA:737] The number 18 is very special in the Gita. Note that every letter has a
[GITA:738] numerical equivalent based on the position of that letter in the Sanskrit
[GITA:739] alphabet which has 16 vowels, 25 consonants and 10 semi vowels. Let us
[GITA:740] review the numerical equivalent for the word ‘ jaya’ (meaning victory)
[GITA:741] which is made up of the letters ja (consonant in the 8 th position) and ya (1st
[GITA:742] semi vowel). Applying the grammat ical rule of reading the numerical
[GITA:743] representations in reverse order, the word ‘ jaya’ is represented by number
[GITA:744] 18. Jaya which means victory , signifies the triumph of good over evil as
[GITA:745] depicted in the Gita and its parent epic, The Mahabharata. Now let us
[GITA:746] review the significance of number 18 in the Gita with the following facts
[GITA:747] [SBG]-
[GITA:749] 1. The Gita has 18 chapters.
[GITA:750] 2. The Mahabharata of which the Gita is a part, has 18 volumes.
[GITA:751] 3. The great war of  the Mahabharata which was the backdrop for the
[GITA:752] Gita was fought over 18 days.
[GITA:754] 4. The armies consisted of 18 regiments with the Kauravas at 11 and
[GITA:755] the Pandavas at 7
[GITA:767] Introduction                                                                                                                                              5
[GITA:769] 5. Each regiment consisted of 21870 elephants, 21870 chariots, 65610
[GITA:770] horses and 109350 soldiers. Each of these numbers sum up to 18.
[GITA:771] For example, in case of 21870, 2+1+8+7+0 = 18
[GITA:773] 6. Duryodhana in his review of the Pandava army  names 18 main
[GITA:774] leaders
[GITA:776] 7. Sanjaya names the 18 conches sounded by the 18 Pandava leaders.
[GITA:778] 8. In the Gita chapter 10, the Lord describes His divine manifestation
[GITA:779] (Vibhuti Roopa) in 18 verses (10.21 to 10.38)
[GITA:781] 9. The Lord Almighty’s omnipresence in the universe is described via
[GITA:782] His 18 forms starting with Hamsa, in Katha Upanishad  (2.2.2),
[GITA:783] which is the basis for many concepts in the Gita.
[GITA:785] Overview of Gita Chapters
[GITA:787] The Gita has 18 chapters, each of which focusses on a specific topic
[GITA:788] and at the same time build s upon the topics covered in previous chapters.
[GITA:789] An enumeration of the chapters and a brief description of the contents of
[GITA:790] each chapter are as follows:
[GITA:792] Section 1: The Path to Divine Knowledge, Chapters 1 – 6 (280 verses)
[GITA:794] Chapter 1 (47 verses) - Arjuna Vishada Yoga  (Arjuna’s Distress): This
[GITA:795] chapter sets the stage for the Gita. The two armies of cousins, the
[GITA:796] Pandavas and  the Kauravas were assembled in Kurukshetra , ready to
[GITA:797] start the war. The proceedings in the wa r were narrated by Sanjaya, an
[GITA:798] aide to the blind king Dhrutarashtra, father of the Kaurava brothers.
[GITA:799] Before the start of the war, Arjuna looks at both the armies and realizes
[GITA:800] that on both sides were many of his near and dear ones such as teachers,
[GITA:801] cousins, uncles, nephews etc.  He develops cold feet at the thought of
[GITA:802] bloodshed between them. He wonders if he is doing the right thing by
[GITA:803] waging this war as it would not only lead to bloodshed but also result in
[GITA:815] 6                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:816] societal degradation. He advances many arguments as  to why he should
[GITA:817] avoid this war and find some other way to lead his life. At the end of this
[GITA:818] chapter, Arjuna who is grief stricken , is seen sitting still in his chariot
[GITA:819] after dropping his weapons, confused as to the way forward.
[GITA:821] Chapter 2  (72 verses) - Sankhya Yoga  (The Path of Doctrines): In this
[GITA:822] chapter, the Lord answers Arjuna’s basic questions about the purpose of
[GITA:823] life and related philosophical concepts. Sensing that Arjuna’s
[GITA:824] reservations about fighting the war were due to his fear of losing his
[GITA:825] loved ones, the Lord delves into the nature of individual souls, the
[GITA:826] indestructibility of souls, the relationship between individual souls and
[GITA:827] the Lord Almighty etc., to remind Arjuna that the Lord gave human
[GITA:828] forms to individual souls to help them in their spir itual journey , and
[GITA:829] everyone must play their dutiful role in society. The Lord urges Arjuna
[GITA:830] not to despair over the hurt that may be caused to his loved ones in the
[GITA:831] war, as they had taken the side of the evil king Duryodhana . Arjuna had
[GITA:832] an obligation to fig ht the just war to protect his citizens. Lord Krishna
[GITA:833] teaches Arjuna to focus on performing his prescribed duty of protecting
[GITA:834] his citizens as an offering to Him and not let his em otions come in the
[GITA:835] way. Chapter 2 can be considered  a summary of the entire Gita as it
[GITA:836] answers Arjuna’s (and through Arjuna, everyone’s) basic questions
[GITA:837] about the purpose of life. The remaining chapters serve to expand on the
[GITA:838] concepts presented in this chapter.
[GITA:840] Chapter 3  (43 verses) - Karma Yoga  (The Path of Action): In this
[GITA:841] chapter, the Lord answers Arjuna’s questions regarding the paths of duty
[GITA:842] (karma) and knowledge ( jnana). Arjuna wonder s if there is a way, he
[GITA:843] could focus on acquiring knowledge and traverse  the path of knowledge
[GITA:844] (jnana) avoiding this dreadful war. The Lord logically answers Arjuna’s
[GITA:845] doubts to convince him that everyone has an obligation to perform their
[GITA:846] duties to society and as a prince, it was his responsibility to fight the just
[GITA:847] war to protect his citizens. To perform one’s duty, one also needs to be
[GITA:848] equipped with knowledge and in that sense, one needs to incorporate
[GITA:849] both karma and jnana in one’s spiritual journey. Based on one’s innate
[GITA:861] Introduction                                                                                                                                              7
[GITA:863] nature, some may be prescribed a path that is dominant in action , and
[GITA:864] others may be prescribed a path dominant in knowledge. This chapter
[GITA:865] also has an excellent discussion on the Cyclic Order of the Universe.
[GITA:867] Chapter 4 (42 verses) - Jnana Yoga (Wisdom in Action ): This chapter is
[GITA:868] predominantly about the spiritual knowledge that a seeker will need to
[GITA:869] perform prescribed action ( karma). Knowledge regarding the individual
[GITA:870] souls, various deities and the attributes of  the Lord are explained to
[GITA:871] instill devotion in a seeker. The Lord explains that He incarnates in this
[GITA:872] world from time to time to establish virtu e and vanquish immorality.
[GITA:873] Knowledge about the  various types of act ions – right action, wrong
[GITA:874] action and non-action are also covered here.
[GITA:876] Chapter 5  (29 verses) - Sanyasa Yoga  (The Path of Renunciation) :
[GITA:877] Renunciation of rewards from actions is termed sanyasa and performing
[GITA:878] prescribed duties as an offering to the Lord is termed yoga (action). In
[GITA:879] this chapter, the Lord answers Arjuna’s questions on some fundamental
[GITA:880] aspects of the two concepts of sanyasa and yoga. Arjuna’s argument was
[GITA:881] that if renunciation were a better option tha n action, he c ould perhaps
[GITA:882] adopt the life of an ascetic and avoid waging the  war. The Lord however
[GITA:883] describes the characteristics of a renunciant and clarifies that one must
[GITA:884] incorporate both these paths to achieve self -realization. The Lord
[GITA:885] reiterates that Arjuna  must focus on performing his prescribed duty of
[GITA:886] waging war to protect his citizens from  the evil Kauravas. This chapter
[GITA:887] also delves into the importance of detachment and self-control.
[GITA:889] Chapter 6  (47 verses) – Atma Samyama  Yoga (The Path of Self
[GITA:890] Restraint) or Dhyana Yoga  (The Path of Meditation) : Yoga (or action)
[GITA:891] has two components – external and internal. The external component
[GITA:892] refers to actions performed as part of one’s prescribed duties which
[GITA:893] would be visible to others. The internal component refers to dhyana (or
[GITA:894] meditation). This chapter has a detailed discussion of dhyana yoga .
[GITA:895] Characteristics of a true yogi are described. The physical aspect of
[GITA:896] meditation such as place , physical pose, breath control etc., are also
[GITA:908] 8                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:909] described. Requirements for moderatio n in consumption are also
[GITA:910] discussed. To a question from Arjuna regarding the condition of those
[GITA:911] who make a sincere attempt but are not able to successfully implement
[GITA:912] karma and dhyana, the Lord teaches that no sincere effort is a waste , and
[GITA:913] such seekers wil l get additional opportunities to complete their spiritual
[GITA:914] journey.
[GITA:916] Section 2: Divine, Spiritual Knowledge, Chapters 7 – 12 (209 verses)
[GITA:918] Chapter 7  (30 verses) - Jnana Vijnana Yoga  (The Path of Knowledge
[GITA:919] and Wisdom ): The first 6 chapters were broadly conc erned with
[GITA:920] descriptions o f the methods and procedures (both external and internal)
[GITA:921] to acquire divine, spiritual knowledge. The next 6 chapters describe in
[GITA:922] more detail such divine, spiritual knowledge about the Lord Almighty ,
[GITA:923] which forms the principle messa ge of the Gita. In earlier chapters 2 – 6,
[GITA:924] there were some discussions on the Lord’s attributes which were
[GITA:925] included contextually, but the next 6 chapters provide more exclusive
[GITA:926] details about the Lord’ attributes. Chapter 7 provides a detailed
[GITA:927] discussion of  the two types of knowledge – indirect (ordinary
[GITA:928] knowledge) and direct  (special knowledge or wisdom). Indirect
[GITA:929] knowledge ( jnana) is that knowledge that is gained from scriptural
[GITA:930] studies and through teachers. Direct knowledge ( vijnana) is specialized
[GITA:931] knowledge about the Lord that one obtains after self -realization. The
[GITA:932] Lord describes His ownership of everything in the universe and stresses
[GITA:933] that He is responsible for even the intrinsic attributes of objects.  The
[GITA:934] causes of ignorance, the influence of maya (delusion) on living beings ,
[GITA:935] and procedures to overcome maya are also discussed.  The various types
[GITA:936] of seekers who are devoted to the Lord are identified.  This chapter ends
[GITA:937] with the Lord stating that one who has proper knowledge about
[GITA:938] Adhiyajna (Lord of Sacri fice) and Adhyatma (Prime Self),  along with
[GITA:939] that of Adhibhoota (Prime Material) and Adhidaiva (Prime Deities), and
[GITA:940] who thinks of Him during the last moments will eventually reach Him.
[GITA:953] Introduction                                                                                                                                              9
[GITA:955] Chapter 8 (28 verses) - Akshara Brahma Yoga  (The Imperishable Lord) :
[GITA:956] This chapter starts with Arjuna asking Krishna 8 questions about the
[GITA:957] topics indicated towards the end of the previous chapter . Arjuna also
[GITA:958] enquires about the need for and advantages of remembering the Lord
[GITA:959] during one’s last moments. This chapter also details the journey of a soul
[GITA:960] after leaving the physical body.
[GITA:962] Chapter 9 (34 verses) - Raja Vidya, Raja Guhya Yoga (Path of Supreme
[GITA:963] Knowledge and Supreme Secrets): This chapter continues with the
[GITA:964] description of some of the important and subtle attributes and act ivities
[GITA:965] of the Lord. In that sense , it is Supreme knowledge that is taught here.
[GITA:966] The Lord uses the term ‘ secretive’ to arouse curiosity in Arjuna (and
[GITA:967] everyone else). While the Lord has infinite auspicious forms, attributes,
[GITA:968] activities etc., there are eigh t activities of  the Lord that directly impact
[GITA:969] living beings. They are – creation ( Srishti), sustenance ( Stithi),
[GITA:970] dissolution (laya), regulation ( niayamana), knowledge ( jnana),
[GITA:971] ignorance (ajnana), bondage (bandha) and liberation (moksha). Together
[GITA:972] they are called Janmadi ashtaka  and they are also covered in this
[GITA:973] chapter.
[GITA:975] Chapter 10 (42 verses) - Vibhooti Yoga (Divine Manifestations) : No one
[GITA:976] can fully comprehend the Lord’s infinite, auspicious attributes. The
[GITA:977] Lord, who is responsible for the creation, suste nance and dissolution of
[GITA:978] the universe, powers everyone and everything. The Lord answers
[GITA:979] Arjuna’s questions about His manifestations and presence in superior
[GITA:980] entities. The Lord’s special presence among both sentient beings (such as
[GITA:981] various deities, animals)  and inert objects (such as mountains, rivers,
[GITA:982] stars, weapons) bestows superiority on these entities. Divine
[GITA:983] manifestations are of two types – direct, where the Lord incarnates in
[GITA:984] different forms such as Rama, Krishna, Vedavyasa etc., and intrinsic,
[GITA:985] where the Lord’s special presence in some objects gives them superiority
[GITA:986] over other objects (ex: Meru’s superiority among mountains, Ganges’s
[GITA:987] superiority among rivers).
[GITA:1000] 10                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:1001] Chapter 11  (55 verses)  - Vishwa Roopa Darshana m (The Lord’s
[GITA:1002] Universal Form) : Arjuna, after l earning about the Lord’s innumerable
[GITA:1003] manifestations, requests the Lord to  allow him to see His Universal form
[GITA:1004] and is granted divine vision by Him. Arjuna sees the Lord having the
[GITA:1005] brightness of thousands of suns, pervading the entire world with infinite
[GITA:1006] limbs, faces with no beginning or end  etc. The Lord’s infinite forms are
[GITA:1007] as real as the universe. This chapter also has a soulful prayer by Arjuna
[GITA:1008] on seeing the Lord’s universal form. While the Lord had previously
[GITA:1009] taught Arjuna about His greatness and attrib utes, the act of physically
[GITA:1010] seeing the Lord’s universal form completely solidifies Arjuna’s faith in
[GITA:1011] Sri Krishna’s teachings.
[GITA:1013] Chapter 12 (20 verses) - Bhakti Yoga (The Path of Devotion) : The Lord
[GITA:1014] answers Arjuna’s questions comparing the worship of Goddess
[GITA:1015] Mahalakshmi and that of the Lord Almighty Narayana. Worship ping
[GITA:1016] Lord Narayana is an easier way to attain moksha, while pleasing
[GITA:1017] Mahalakshmi is difficult. Further, Sri Lakshmi operates under the Lord’s
[GITA:1018] control. One should propitiate Sri Lakshmi and other deities that are part
[GITA:1019] of the Lord’s entourage for maximum effect. Bhakti or devotion is
[GITA:1020] focusing one’s mind on the Lord. The Lord teaches other ways of
[GITA:1021] devotion using facilities such as intellect, studying scriptures, performing
[GITA:1022] prescribed duties etc. The l ast 8 verses describe the characteristics of an
[GITA:1023] ideal devotee who is dear to the Lord.
[GITA:1025] Section 3: Reiteration of Concepts in Sections 1 and 2, Chapters 13 – 18
[GITA:1026] (212 verses)
[GITA:1028] Chapter 13  (35 verses)  - Kshetra Kshetrajna Yoga  (The Field and the
[GITA:1029] Knower of the  Field): The f irst section cover s the tools and utilities to
[GITA:1030] acquire Divine knowledge which itself was covered in detail in the
[GITA:1031] second section. This third section expands on some of the critical issues
[GITA:1032] briefly covered in the first two sections. In chapter 7, verse (7.4), the
[GITA:1033] Lord briefly speaks about eight-fold nature which operate s under His
[GITA:1034] command and control. This chapter details that field or theatre of
[GITA:1046] Introduction                                                                                                                                              11
[GITA:1048] operations and the one who knows them.  The interaction between the
[GITA:1049] components of nature (sentient an d inert) and living beings are also
[GITA:1050] discussed.
[GITA:1052] Chapter 14  (27 verses) - Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga  (Division of
[GITA:1053] Qualities): This chapter has details on the three qualities of nature (sattv
[GITA:1054] – piety, rajas – passion, tamas – ignorance) which define one’s
[GITA:1055] personality. These concepts were introduced in chapter 3 (3.5) and are
[GITA:1056] expanded here. Creation of the universe through sentient Mother Nature
[GITA:1057] is described. The ways in which the three qualities bind a person are also
[GITA:1058] explained. The methods to escape from the clutches of the three qualities
[GITA:1059] are described.
[GITA:1061] Chapter 15 (20 verses) - Purushottama Yoga (Theology of the Supreme
[GITA:1062] Being): This chapter is considered by many to have the core teachings of
[GITA:1063] the Gita. The Bhagavad Gita has 700 verses spread among 18 chapters .
[GITA:1064] Interestingly, this chapter which has 20 verses has 700 letters  (15 verses
[GITA:1065] have 32 letters each and the remaining 5 verses have 44 letters  each)!
[GITA:1066] This gives credence to this chapter’s importance based on numerology.
[GITA:1067] While the Lord had previously described the components of the universe
[GITA:1068] such as living beings, inert objects, and the Lord Almighty, in this
[GITA:1069] chapter the Lord illustrates the interrelations among them using the
[GITA:1070] example of a banyan tree.  In verse 15, the Lord explicitly states His
[GITA:1071] presence in every one and declares that He is the primary subject matter
[GITA:1072] of the Vedas. In verses 16 -20, the Lord emphatically describes Himself
[GITA:1073] as the Supreme Being intrinsically different from all other beings,
[GITA:1074] thereby convincingly establishing the philosophy of dualis m ( dvaita)
[GITA:1075] which was propagated by Sri Madhwacharya.
[GITA:1077] Chapter 16 (24 verses) - Daivasura Sampat Vibh aga Yoga (The Divine
[GITA:1078] and the Demoniac Nature): This chapter delves deep into the types of
[GITA:1079] human nature. In the previous chapters, there were many references to
[GITA:1080] pious and virtuous people with divine nature and to people with
[GITA:1081] demoniac nature. This chapter provides more details on human traits.
[GITA:1093] 12                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:1094] These traits typically are intrinsic to an individual. One cannot judge
[GITA:1095] people based on external appearance, position in so ciety etc. The
[GITA:1096] personality traits of p eople with divine nature and those with demoniac
[GITA:1097] nature are described in detail.
[GITA:1099] Chapter 17  (28 verses)  - Shraddhatraya Vibhaga Yoga  (The Threefold
[GITA:1100] Faith): In the previous chapters , especially chapter 14 , the nature o f
[GITA:1101] individuals influenced by the qualities of sattv, rajas, tamas were stated
[GITA:1102] a number of  times. This chapter has more details on the concept of
[GITA:1103] threefold faith with detailed discussion on the impact of these qualities
[GITA:1104] on various issues such as faith, food habits, sacrificial rituals, charitable
[GITA:1105] giving, meditation etc.
[GITA:1107] Chapter 18  (78 verses)  - Mokshasanyasa Yoga  (Liberation and
[GITA:1108] Renunciation): This chapter starts with a discussion on the subtle
[GITA:1109] differences between renunciation ( sanyasa) and relinquishment of  the
[GITA:1110] rewards of labour ( tyaga). The types of rewards from actions are also
[GITA:1111] discussed. The five prerequisites required for performing acti vity are
[GITA:1112] identified. Different types of knowledge, action, doers, intellect,
[GITA:1113] determination, and happiness are also disc ussed. Additional details on
[GITA:1114] the four societal categories of people are provided (this was briefly
[GITA:1115] indicated in (4.13) ). The concept of liberation ( moksha) is discussed in
[GITA:1116] detail in this chapter. The first 55 verses contain a discussion on the
[GITA:1117] topics ident ified so far. The Lord concludes His sermon in the next 17
[GITA:1118] verses. Arjuna responds to Lord Krishna’s teachings in verse 73.
[GITA:1119] Sanjaya, who has been describing the proceedings of the war and the
[GITA:1120] Lord’s glorious expounding of dharma (The Gita) to Arjuna ,
[GITA:1121] euphorically concludes his commentary in the following 5 verses.
[GITA:1123] Organization of the Book
[GITA:1125] This book is primarily based on the interpretation of the Gita by Sri
[GITA:1126] Raghavendra Swamy (Sri Rayaru) in his pioneering work, Gita Vivruti .
[GITA:1127] Vivruti means ‘explanation’ an d in  the Gita Vivruti , Sri Rayaru has
[GITA:1128] consolidated unique interpretations on the Gita by Sri Madhwacharya (in
[GITA:1140] Introduction                                                                                                                                              13
[GITA:1142] his works Gita Bhashya, Gita Tatparya Nirnaya ) and commentaries on
[GITA:1143] these two works by Sri Jaya Teertha  (Prameya Deepika  and Nyaya
[GITA:1144] Deepika). Gita B hashya is the very first work of Sri Madhwacharya,
[GITA:1145] where he provided  a unique interpretation of the Gita. In a subsequent
[GITA:1146] work, Gita Tatparya Nirnaya , Sri Madhwacharya provides detailed
[GITA:1147] arguments and the scriptural basis for many of the interpretations of Gita
[GITA:1148] Bhashya.
[GITA:1150] This book has 18 main chapters with each chapter corresponding to
[GITA:1151] the relevant chapter in the Gita. In each chapter, the book presents the
[GITA:1152] original Sanskrit verse along with a simple translation in English. At the
[GITA:1153] end of the original text, a n explanation of key concepts covered in the
[GITA:1154] chapter is provided , based on authentic commentaries on the Gita by Sri
[GITA:1155] Raghavendra Teertha (Sri Rayaru) in his work Gita Vivruti and on lectures
[GITA:1156] by Sri Vidyasagara Madhava Teertha . At the end of each chapter, a
[GITA:1157] summary of that chapter is provided. The summary section also refers to
[GITA:1158] relevant verses in that chapter  for clarity , and this section can be read
[GITA:1159] ‘stand-alone’ by those readers who want a quick summary of the various
[GITA:1160] chapters. It is hoped that the readers will find this version useful in better
[GITA:1161] understanding the greatest psychological manual ever written – The
[GITA:1162] Bhagavad Gita.
[GITA:1164] Sri Vishnu Teertha from Madinur, a great saint  philosopher of the
[GITA:1165] 18th century has identified one verse from each chapter of the Gita as a
[GITA:1166] representation of the core tenets of that entire chapter  in his work
[GITA:1167] Bhagavad Gita Saroddhara . This was done to help devotees who wanted
[GITA:1168] to chant the Gita everyday but could not chant all 700 verses. These core
[GITA:1169] verses are highlighted in this book in italics.
[GITA:1171] This book has 3 annexures. The first annexure contains a section
[GITA:1172] from the epic Varaha Purana which describes the glory of The Gita and
[GITA:1173] is typically read after completing a reading of the Gita. The second
[GITA:1174] annexure has a discussion on the philoso phical interpretation of the Gita
[GITA:1175] with a sample illustration. The third annexure is about the core tenets of the
[GITA:1187] 14                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:1188] philosophy of Sri Madhwacharya and the corresponding verses in the Gita
[GITA:1189] that support these tenets.
[GITA:1191] The last section of this book identifies l iterature cited in this book.
[GITA:1192] The principal references are the Gita, part of  the great epic the
[GITA:1193] Mahabharata and commentaries on the  Gita by Sri Madhwacharya, Sri
[GITA:1194] Jaya Teertha and Sri Raghavendra Teertha. The references are indicated by
[GITA:1195] their initials withi n square brackets. For example, the Gita Bhashya  is
[GITA:1196] identified as [GB].

[GITA:1227] Benedictory Verse  (Gita Vivruti) : After saluting Lord Narayana
[GITA:1228] (consort of Lakshmi ), Sri Madhwacharya,  and other teachers , we are
[GITA:1229] summarizing the concepts from Gita Bhashya, Gita Tatparya Nirnaya
[GITA:1230] and related commentaries which offer a unique perspective on the
[GITA:1231] Bhagavad Gita taught by Lord Sri Krishna.
[GITA:1232] Chapter Introduction: Sri Vedavyasa composed the great epic
[GITA:1233] Mahabharata which contain s all the essential teachings from the Vedas,
[GITA:1234] and this allows even those who do not have access or eligibility to learn the
[GITA:1235] Vedas to gain necessary knowledge to help them in their spiritual journey.
[GITA:1236] The epic Mahabharata is spread over 18 volumes and the Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:1237] (or Gita, in short), is part of Bheeshma Parva (or the Book of Bheeshma).
[GITA:1238] The Mahabharata is compared to the divine flower parijata, and the Gita
[GITA:1239] is like the nectar (or essence)  of the flower. Sri Raghavendra Teertha (Sri
[GITA:1240] Rayaru) has composed a unique commentary on the Gita titled, Gita
[GITA:1241] Vivruti [GV] which is a summary of the two commentaries on  the Gita by
[GITA:1253] 16                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:1254] Sri Madhwacharya namely, Gita Bhashya  [GB] and Gita Tatparya
[GITA:1255] Nirnaya [GTN]. The Gita has 70 1 verses spread over  18 chapters. Sri
[GITA:1256] Rayaru has organized these 18 chapters into 3 sections of 6 chapters each .
[GITA:1257] The first se ction (chapters 1 -6) broadly describe s the proce sses and
[GITA:1258] prerequisites required to achieve divine, spiritual knowledge that one would
[GITA:1259] need in one’s spi ritual journey. The second section (chapters 7 -12)
[GITA:1260] describes the nature of the divine, spiritual knowledge and the third se ction
[GITA:1261] (chapters 13-18) expands on some of the key concepts covered in sections 1
[GITA:1262] and 2.
[GITA:1263] The Bhagavad Gita is a conversation between A rjuna, and Lord
[GITA:1264] Krishna as narrated by Lord Vedavyasa in the epic, Mahabharata. The
[GITA:1265] great war between the armies of the Kaurava and  Pandava cousins, was
[GITA:1266] witnessed by Sanjaya, the aide of the blind King Dhrutarashtra who was
[GITA:1267] head of the Kaurava dynasty. Sanjaya rushes to Dhrutarashtra soon after the
[GITA:1268] fall of Bheeshma, the commander of the Kaurava army  [Mahabharata,
[GITA:1269] Bheeshma Parva, Chapter 13] . The stunned Dhrutarashtra wants to know
[GITA:1270] everything that happened on the battlefield from the very beginning.
[GITA:1271] Sanjaya narrates all the events from the beginning of the war. He stays with
[GITA:1272] the king till the end of the war relaying all the events to him. He can do this
[GITA:1273] because Sage Vedavyasa grants him divine vision to remotely view the war
[GITA:1274] and provide him with updates.
[GITA:1275] All 47 verses in the first chapter and the first 10 verses in the second
[GITA:1276] chapter provide the background and context for Arjuna’s apprehensions
[GITA:1277] about the war, and Lord Krishna starts His sermon to Arjuna then onwards.
[GITA:1278] Dhrutarashtra starts by asking the following question to Sanjaya.
[GITA:1279] What did my Clan and the Pandavas do in Kurukshetra?

[GITA:1298] Dhrutarashtra said:  O Sanjaya! Assembled at Kuru Kshetra, the
[GITA:1299] designated land f or committing righteous acts ( Field of Righteousness),
[GITA:1300] what did my clan of Kauravas and Pandavas do? (1.1)
[GITA:1302] Comments: The first verse in the Gita starts with King
[GITA:1303] Dhrutarashtra asking the above question to his aide Sanjaya. The first word
[GITA:1304] here is ‘Dharma’ which is one of the names of the Lord Almighty who
[GITA:1305] shoulders (dharana) the universe. In that sense , the first verse also acts as a
[GITA:1306] benedictory verse of the Gita.
[GITA:1308] The King begins by asking Sanjaya what happened between his clan
[GITA:1309] (Kauravas) and the Pandavas in Kurukshetra which was known as Dharma
[GITA:1310] Kshetra or the ‘Field of Righteousness ’. This question reveals the King’s
[GITA:1311] apprehensions. He was convinced that  the Pandavas with the guidance of
[GITA:1312] Lord Krishna would be invincible (but Krishna had sworn not to take up
[GITA:1313] arms). On the other hand,  Bheeshma was also known to be invincible and
[GITA:1314] so the King hoped against hope that his sons would not be defeated in this
[GITA:1315] war that was being fought in an area known as the ‘Field of Righteousness’.
[GITA:1316] Hence, he was surprised to hear that Bheeshma had fallen.
[GITA:1318] Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha Swamiji in his work Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:1319] Saroddhara [BGS] identifies this verse as the central piece of chapter 1.
[GITA:1320] After all, chapter 1 sets the context for the entire Gita, and it starts with
[GITA:1321] King Dhrutarasht ra’s question. The theatre of war is our body , and the
[GITA:1322] armies represent the angelic and demoniac forces inside each of us. The
[GITA:1323] interaction between them is the context for the Gita.

[GITA:1344] Sanjaya said:  King Duryodhana , upon seeing the formation of the
[GITA:1345] Pandavas’ army, immediately rushed to  his teacher Drona, and said as
[GITA:1346] follows. (1.2)
[GITA:1348] Comments: Sanjaya answers Dhrutarashtra’s question in the
[GITA:1349] following 9 verses. Sri Sumateendra Teertha in his Bhava Ratna Kosha
[GITA:1350] [BRK] draws attention to the use of the word ‘ tu’ as implying
[GITA:1351] Duryodhana’s anxiety as soon as he saw the formidable Pandava army (‘tu’
[GITA:1352] is normally used to add emphasis). Hence, the Kaurava prince immediately
[GITA:1353] rushes to  his teacher Drona.  It is interesting to note that Duryodhana
[GITA:1354] approaches his teacher Drona and not the commander of the Kaurava
[GITA:1355] forces, Bheeshma,  to give him inf ormation about the Pandava army ,
[GITA:1356] perhaps to acknowledge the fact that many warriors in  the Pandava army
[GITA:1357] were Drona’s students.

[GITA:1366] Comments: Duryodhana reminds Drona that the formation of the
[GITA:1367] Pandava army has been organized by Dhrushtadyumna, a  brilliant warrior
[GITA:1368] who learnt the art of warfare from Drona  himself, implying that  the
[GITA:1369] Pandavas have a formidable army formation. Duryodhana also refers to the
[GITA:1370] Pandavas’ army as mighty, even though his own army was much bigger.

[GITA:1396] as Bheema and Arjuna. (1.4)
[GITA:1398] Other brave warriors include Drushtaketu, Chekitana, Kashiraja who
[GITA:1399] are extraordinarily strong , Purujit, Kuntibhoja and Shybhya who are
[GITA:1400] superior among men. (1.5)
[GITA:1402] Yudhamanyu, the brave warrior, Uttamowja , the strong warrior,
[GITA:1403] Abhimanyu, son of Subhadra, and sons of Draupadi are also here. They too
[GITA:1404] are Maharathas. (1.6)
[GITA:1406] Comments:  Duryodhana recognizes and names 18 leaders from the
[GITA:1407] Pandava army whom he considers as being comparable to Bheema and
[GITA:1408] Arjuna in valor. They are – Dhrushtadyumna, Satyaki, Virata, Drupada,
[GITA:1409] Drushtaketu, Chekitana, Kashiraja, Purujit, Kuntibhoja, Shybhya,
[GITA:1410] Yudhamanyu, Uttamowja, Abhimanyu and the five sons of Draupadi
[GITA:1411] (Parativindya, Sutasoma, Shrutakeerti, Shataneeka, Shrutakarma). These
[GITA:1412] leaders were termed  ‘Maharathas’, meaning they were capable of single -
[GITA:1413] handedly fighting 10,000 enemy soldiers. They were experts in the use of
[GITA:1414] both types of weapons – astra and shastra. Here, astra refers to weapons
[GITA:1415] such as arrows that are launched after praying and invoking  a deity , and
[GITA:1416] shastra refers to arrows that are launched without such invocation.
[GITA:1418] Interestingly, Duryodhana does not name Krishna who was
[GITA:1419] charioteering Arjuna. This is perhaps due to Krishna’s vow that He would
[GITA:1420] not take up arms in the war. Duryodhana prob ably thought Krishna d id not
[GITA:1421] count if He was not fighting. A big miscalculation!

[GITA:1456] Comments: Duryodhana now names 7 leaders from his side. He
[GITA:1457] indicates that they are all ready to sacrifice their lives for him. Duryodhana
[GITA:1458] is looking at this war purely to justify holding onto  the Pandavas’ share of
[GITA:1459] the kingdom and believes that everyone in his side is fighting to please him
[GITA:1460] and not for any higher cause. It is interesting to note that while Duryodhana
[GITA:1461] names 18 leaders from the Pandavas, he only rattles 7 names from his side.
[GITA:1462] Further he does not name his brothers such as Dushasana. This points to

[GITA:1484] beginning to have doubts about the capabilities of his army. He knows that
[GITA:1485] his is not a just cause, but as a representation of Kali, the evil soul, it is in
[GITA:1486] his nature to adamantly get into a war even when he knows that he is wrong
[GITA:1487] and that his side is not capable of winning. Note that while
[GITA:1488] Dhrushtadyumna is the commander of the Pandavas’ army, Duryodhana
[GITA:1489] recognizes that the real leader of  the Pandavas is the hugely experienced

[GITA:1534] Conch-shells, bugles, trumpets, drums, and cow horns were sounded

[GITA:1538] Comments: Taking a cue from Bheeshma, other Kaurava leaders
[GITA:1539] sounded various organs to signal their readiness and command their troops

[GITA:1541] a musical instrument with spiritual significance which has a pleasant sound,
[GITA:1542] other leaders sound different instruments, many making harsh sounds not in
[GITA:1543] harmony with each other. Perhaps an indication of disharmony and disunity
[GITA:1544] among the Kauravas.

[GITA:1549] At this time, Lord Madhava (Krishna) and Arjuna, son of Pandu,
[GITA:1550] who were seated on a magnificent chariot pulled by white horses, sounded
[GITA:1551] their respective divine conch shells. (1.14)
[GITA:1553] Comments: Lord Krishna and Arjuna sounding their conches while
[GITA:1554] seated in a horse drawn chariot also has a spiritual interpretation. As noted
[GITA:1555] by Sri Vidyamanya Teertha in his GPM, as per the Upanishads, the chariot
[GITA:1556] is a representation of the human body. The wandering horses represent the
[GITA:1557] sense organs, and the road travelled represents the objects of sense
[GITA:1558] pleasure. The charioteer (Krishna) represents the intellect , and the leash
[GITA:1559] which controls the horses represents the mind. The charioteer (Krishna) and
[GITA:1560] the passenger (Arjuna) respectively represent the Supreme Soul and the
[GITA:1561] individual soul resident in each body. The conch is shaped like the
[GITA:1573] Chapter 1                                                                                                                                              23
[GITA:1575] primordial symbol ‘Om’ which is the root letter of all scriptures. Hence the
[GITA:1576] conversation between Krishna an d Arjuna represents the collective wisdom

[GITA:1644] Comments: Arjuna wants to take a good look at the armies which
[GITA:1645] consisted of all major, accomplished rulers and warriors of that time. In this
[GITA:1646] verse, a reference is made to the flag of Arjuna’s chariot which  bears the
[GITA:1647] figure of Lord Hanuman, the great warrior from the Ramayana. This
[GITA:1648] indicates that both the  Supreme Soul (paramatma = Lord Krishna) and the

[GITA:1650] Hanuman) are protecting Arjuna.

[GITA:1710] Sanjaya said: O Bhaarata! ( Dhrutarashtra, from the lineage of King
[GITA:1711] Bharata)! Lord Hrishikesha (Krishna), addressed thus by Gudakesha
[GITA:1712] (Arjuna) positioned the grand chariot in between the two armies. (1.24)
[GITA:1713] Turning the chariot towards Bheesh ma, Drona and other kings, Lord
[GITA:1714] Krishna said - O Partha (Arjuna)! Look at all the Kauravas assembled here.
[GITA:1715] (1.25)
[GITA:1716] Comments: Arjuna is referred to as Gudakesha – the one who has
[GITA:1717] conquered sleep ( gudaka). Sleep , along with lethargy represents tamas
[GITA:1718] (ignorance). Sleep is probably the most difficult state for one to overcome.
[GITA:1719] Thus, anyone who can control sleep is said to have control over sense
[GITA:1720] organs. Hence, Arjuna is most eligible to receive the sermon from the Lord.
[GITA:1721] The Lord is referred to as Hrishikesha, on e who has control over
[GITA:1722] everyone’s sense organs and indeed on everyone and everything in the
[GITA:1723] universe.

[GITA:1736] of Kunti) was overwhelmed by emotion and addresse d Sri Krishna with
[GITA:1737] great anxiety. (1.27)
[GITA:1738] Comments: While Arjuna knew that many of his near and dear ones
[GITA:1739] would be par ticipating in the war, he is overwhelmed when he sees all of
[GITA:1751] Chapter 1                                                                                                                                              27
[GITA:1753] them assembled in one place. Faced with the prospect of many of them
[GITA:1754] dying, regardless of who w on the war, Arjuna is overcome with grief and
[GITA:1755] emotion.
[GITA:1757] Sri Rayaru in GV  provides an explanation for  the term vishada
[GITA:1758] which is used to express Arjuna’s emotion. Vishada means mental
[GITA:1759] weakness caused by grief, which is a result of delusion , which in turn is
[GITA:1760] caused by the fear of losing loved ones.

[GITA:1776] Comments: From this verse, till the end of this chapter is a

[GITA:1779] people including many of his near and dear ones. Note that Arjuna begins
[GITA:1780] describing his anxiety to the Lord by addressing Him as Krishna. This has a
[GITA:1781] special significance. Sri Madhwacharya in his Gita Bhashya  [GB] (5th
[GITA:1782] Chapter), interprets Krishna as ‘ Lokarakshaka’, the one who controls
[GITA:1783] everyone and everything in the universe. By using this term, Arjuna
[GITA:1784] expresses his faith that Lord Krishna will have a solution to his grief.

[GITA:1813] O Krishna! I do not aspire for victory, kingdom,  or happiness. O!
[GITA:1814] Govinda! What use is this kingdom, luxuries, or even living? (1.32)
[GITA:1816] Comments: Sri Madhwacharya in his Gita Bhashya [GB], interprets
[GITA:1817] the Lord’s name Keshava, as the one who inspires even deities Brahma (ka)
[GITA:1818] and Rudra (esha). Arjuna, by us ing this term to address the Lord expresses
[GITA:1819] his complete faith that Lord Krishna who inspires even deities Brahma and
[GITA:1820] Rudra, can surely help him. Arjuna ’s sensing of bad omens reflects his
[GITA:1821] weak mind (If these omens were indeed predicting bad outcomes, he would
[GITA:1822] have lost the war, which did not happen).

[GITA:1862] Note that Arjuna addresses Krishna as Madhusoodana. Demons
[GITA:1863] Madhu and Kaitabha were born out of Krishna’s sweat and in that sense are
[GITA:1864] Krishna’s children. As they grew up, they became very evil, and Krishna
[GITA:1865] had no choice but to destroy them. Arjuna indicate s here that he does not

[GITA:1891] are our own relatives. How can we achieve happiness by killing our own
[GITA:1892] people? (1.37)
[GITA:1894] Comments: Arjuna refers to the Kauravas as atatayina which means
[GITA:1895] those who have committed one or more of the following six sins – torching
[GITA:1896] others, poisoning others, using weapons against the unprotected, stealing
[GITA:1897] others’ land, money, and women. It is the duty of someone in Arjuna’s
[GITA:1898] position to destroy those who commit these sins. It is his duty  to preserve
[GITA:1899] and protect the innocent in society. While A rjuna is aware that the
[GITA:1900] Kauravas deserve to be punished, he is worried that doing so would result
[GITA:1901] in collateral damage – that is the death of his relatives, elders and teachers
[GITA:1902] which would result in him accumulating sins.

[GITA:1934] These Kauravas who are greedy for the kingdom have no knowledge
[GITA:1935] of the sins they  would accumulate by killing their family members and by
[GITA:1936] betraying their friends. (1.38)
[GITA:1938] O Janardana! How can we, who understand the perils of destroying
[GITA:1939] families, not be aware of the need to stay away from these sinful acts?
[GITA:1940] (1.39)
[GITA:1942] With the destruction of the families, traditional familial virtues will
[GITA:1943] perish. When virtuousness declines, unrighteousness will permeate society.
[GITA:1944] (1.40)
[GITA:1946] O Vaarshneya! The rise of unrighteousness will cause surviving
[GITA:1947] women to stray away from morality. Women devoid of morals r esult in
[GITA:1948] unholy families. (1.41)
[GITA:1950] Rise of unholy families will push the lineage of children and
[GITA:1951] grandchildren to hell and departed elders who are deprived of appropriate
[GITA:1952] offerings will also fall into hell. (1.42)
[GITA:1954] Comments: Arjuna tries to make a case for avoiding the battle by
[GITA:1955] putting forward additional arguments. His initial argument was that the war
[GITA:1956] would result in the loss of many innocent lives , including elders and
[GITA:1957] teachers who were pious and revered. Here he argues that the loss of many
[GITA:1958] men in the wa r would lead to instability in society and give rise to unholy
[GITA:1959] families. This would result in  the loss of compulsory rituals  such as
[GITA:1960] offerings to departed elders . Arjuna also says that the Kauravas are blinded
[GITA:1961] by their greed and are unable to see the peril s of such a war. But how could
[GITA:1962] the Pandavas who are a lot more knowledgeable about such perils be
[GITA:1963] similarly blinded?

[GITA:1989] Such sinful deeds by destroyers of families will result in co rruption
[GITA:1990] of virtuous classes and decline of virtuous familial traditions. (1.43)
[GITA:1992] O Janardana! We have heard from elders that people whose virtuous
[GITA:1993] familial traditions are destroyed are sure to fall into hell. (1.44)
[GITA:1995] Alas! We are about to commit a great s in by killing our own people
[GITA:1996] because of our greed for kingdom and for the sake of happiness. (1.45)
[GITA:1998] It would be better for me if I relinquish ed my weapons and offer ed
[GITA:1999] no resistance while Dhrutarashtra’s sons kill me in this war. (1.46)
[GITA:2001] Comments: Arjuna now summarizes his arguments for staying away
[GITA:2002] from the war. Firstly, he would be committing a great sin by killing near
[GITA:2003] and dear ones which included elders and teachers who were pious and
[GITA:2004] revered. Secondly, the loss of millions of men would lead to instabil ity in
[GITA:2005] society due to straying away from traditions related to a class ( jati dharma)
[GITA:2006] and traditions specific to families ( kula dharma ). In addition, anyone
[GITA:2007] causing these would accrue sins to their departed elders. Arjuna laments
[GITA:2008] that he is about to commit great sins in waging this war , the purpose of
[GITA:2009] which is to gain the kingdom. He is convinced that it is better for him to
[GITA:2010] relinquish his weapons and let the Kauravas kill him as that would prevent
[GITA:2011] him from accruing sins and in fact may lead him to heavens h ereafter for
[GITA:2012] his noble act.
[GITA:2025] Chapter 1                                                                                                                                              33
[GITA:2027] As will be seen later, Arjuna fights the war and  the Pandavas
[GITA:2028] successfully rule their kingdom for many years. None of Arjuna’s fears
[GITA:2029] come true. The evil clan of the Kauravas and their supporters such as the
[GITA:2030] virtuous but guilty Bheeshma and Drona are vanquished, and society does
[GITA:2031] not fall apart.  In fact, Bharat enjoys a long, peaceful and prosperous period
[GITA:2032] under Pandavas’ rule. The Gita clearly suggests that omens do not have
[GITA:2033] any predictive value and  chastise superstitious practi ces. Arjuna’s
[GITA:2034] experience of bad omens reflect his weak mental condition which is caused
[GITA:2035] by his excessive attachment to his near and dear ones.

[GITA:2043] Sanjaya said: Having said thus, Arjuna , stricken with deep sorrow in
[GITA:2044] his mind , drops his bow and arrows and sits still in the middle of his
[GITA:2045] chariot. (1.47)
[GITA:2047] Comments: While Arjuna indicates to Krishna his anxiety and
[GITA:2048] unwillingness to wage war,  his relinquishing of  his bow and arrows is a
[GITA:2049] signal to his large army that he is not yet ready to start the war . (The army
[GITA:2050] of course  could not have heard the conversation between Arjuna and
[GITA:2051] Krishna). This action has le d to the ir enemies drawing their own
[GITA:2052] conclusions which Krishna indicates later.
[GITA:2054] Summary of Chapter 1
[GITA:2056] The Bhagavad Gita  is a conversation between Arjuna  and Lord
[GITA:2057] Krishna as narrated by Lord Vedavyasa in the epic, Mahabharata. The
[GITA:2058] great war between the armies of the Kaurava and the  Pandava cousins, was
[GITA:2059] witnessed by Sanjaya, aide of the blind King Dhrutarashtra who was head
[GITA:2060] of the Kaurava dynasty. Sanjaya rushes to Dhrutarashtra soon after the fall
[GITA:2072] 34                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:2073] of Bheeshma, the commander of the Kaurava army. The stunned
[GITA:2074] Dhrutarashtra wants to know everythin g that happened on the battlefield
[GITA:2075] from the very beginning. Sanjaya narrates all the events from the beginning
[GITA:2076] of the war. He stays with the king till the end of the war relaying all the
[GITA:2077] events to him. He can do this because Sage Vedavyasa grants him divin e
[GITA:2078] vision to view the war remotely and provide Dhrutarashtra the updates.
[GITA:2079] The King starts by asking Sanjaya as to what happened between his
[GITA:2080] clan (the Kauravas) and the Pandavas in Kurukshetra (which is known as
[GITA:2081] Dharma Kshetra or the ‘ Field of Righteousness ’) (1.1). This question
[GITA:2082] reveals the King’s apprehensions.  He is convinced  that the Pandavas with
[GITA:2083] the guidance of Lord Krishna would be invincible (but, Krishna has sworn
[GITA:2084] not to touch or take up arms ).  On the other hand, Bheeshma, the very
[GITA:2085] epitome of justi ce, was also  known to be invincible. The King  was
[GITA:2086] therefore hoping  against hope that his sons would not be defeated ,
[GITA:2087] especially in a war that was being fought in an area known as the Field of
[GITA:2088] Righteousness. So, he was shocked to  hear that Bheeshma had fallen.
[GITA:2089] Sanjaya responds , saying that initially Duryodhana looks at the Pandava
[GITA:2090] army and rushes to inform his teacher Dronacharya about its strength. He
[GITA:2091] makes sure to let him know that the army is being led by Dhrishtadyumna ,
[GITA:2092] a student of Drona himself . Then h e goes on to enumerate other great
[GITA:2093] leaders on the side of the Pandavas. These leaders were termed
[GITA:2094] ‘Maharathas’, meaning they were capable of single-handed fighting with
[GITA:2095] 10,000 enemy soldiers. In all, Duryodhana enumerates 18 leaders from the
[GITA:2096] Pandavas’ side, other than the five Pandava brothers. Interestingly, he does
[GITA:2097] not recognize Krishna as being a part of the Pandava side. This is because
[GITA:2098] Krishna had vowed not to use any arms in the war. Duryodhana obviously
[GITA:2099] did not realize the invaluable advice and guida nce that Krishna would be
[GITA:2100] providing to Arjuna. Ultimately, this miscalculation had lead to the
[GITA:2101] Kauravas’ defeat. This illustrates the peril of ignoring the Lord who is
[GITA:2102] responsible for everything in this universe , just because one cannot
[GITA:2103] physically see Him. (1.2-1.6). Duryodhana then enumerates the great
[GITA:2104] warriors on his side which included – Dronacharya, Bheeshma, Karna,
[GITA:2105] Krupa, Ashwatthama, Vikarna and Bhoorishravas. However, he did not
[GITA:2106] expect the Pandavas to turn up with a huge, well-organized army. He
[GITA:2118] Chapter 1                                                                                                                                              35
[GITA:2120] knows that in addition to the experienced warriors, the Pandava army also
[GITA:2121] included the 5 young children of Draupadi and each of them was brave and
[GITA:2122] capable. He  also knows  that while Dhrushtadyumna is the commander of
[GITA:2123] the Pandava army, it is really the invincibl e Bheema who is their star
[GITA:2124] warrior. Duryodhana is now clearly very perturbed. He wants to ensure that
[GITA:2125] Bheeshma is well protected as he sees Bheeshma as extremely critical to
[GITA:2126] his victory. He asks Dronacharya and others to ensure Bheeshma’s safety
[GITA:2127] (1.7-1.11). At this time, sensing Duryodhana’s worry, Bheeshma decided to
[GITA:2128] instil confidence in him by loudly roaring like a lion and sounding his
[GITA:2129] conch. Other soldiers in the Kaurava army follow by sounding drums,
[GITA:2130] trumpets, bugles etc, and the collective sound seemed to envelope the entire
[GITA:2131] space. Now it is the turn of the Pandavas. Sri Krishna and Arjuna , while
[GITA:2132] seated in their chariots sound their respective conches followed by other
[GITA:2133] leaders in their army. The collective sound of these conches reverberated
[GITA:2134] across ear th and sky and seem ed to shatter the hearts of King
[GITA:2135] Dhrutarashtra’s sons. It is interesting to note that while the Kauravas used
[GITA:2136] various instruments to sound their readiness, the Pandavas uniformly
[GITA:2137] sounded their respective conches for  the maximum effect. L ord Krishna
[GITA:2138] and Arjuna sounding their conches while seated in a horse drawn chariot
[GITA:2139] also has a spiritual interpretation. The chariot is a representation of the
[GITA:2140] human body as noted in the Upanishads. The horses which pull the chariot
[GITA:2141] represent the sense org ans, and the road s travelled represent  objects of
[GITA:2142] sense pleasure. The charioteer (Krishna) represent s the intellect , and the
[GITA:2143] leash which controls the horses represent s the mind. The charioteer
[GITA:2144] (Krishna) and the passenger (Arjuna) represent the Supreme soul  and the
[GITA:2145] individual soul resident in each body. The conch is shaped like the
[GITA:2146] primordial symbol ‘Om’ which is the root letter of all scriptures. Hence the
[GITA:2147] conversation between Krishna and Arjuna represent s the collective wisdom
[GITA:2148] of all the scriptures such as the Vedas (1.12-1.19). Arjuna requests Krishna
[GITA:2149] to take the chariot to the middle of the battleground so that he can have a
[GITA:2150] good look at both the armies. He recognizes his teachers, cousins, nephews,
[GITA:2151] uncles, grand uncles, children, friends etc., and gets very depressed. He is
[GITA:2152] distressed at the very thought of waging a war where he himself might kill
[GITA:2153] many of his near and dear ones. Arjuna tells Krishna that his body is
[GITA:2165] 36                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:2166] trembling, and  that he is unable to hold his weapons . He was feeling
[GITA:2167] disoriented and disil lusioned. He was further seeing bad omens and felt
[GITA:2168] there was nothing good coming out of this war. He says he does not crave
[GITA:2169] for victory, or a kingdom won after losing so many near and dear ones
[GITA:2170] (1.20-1.39). He reasons that with massive destruction of men, familial
[GITA:2171] values would perish, and unrighteousness would take over society. Arjuna
[GITA:2172] says that such a war has no benefits either here or hereafter. He says he
[GITA:2173] would rather drop his weapons and let  the Kauravas kill him rather than be
[GITA:2174] responsible for such a de structive war. Saying thus, Arjuna drops his
[GITA:2175] weapon to the ground and sits in his chariot feeling extremely dejected
[GITA:2176] (1.40-1.47).
[GITA:2178] The rest of the Gita is a sermon from Lord Krishna to Arjuna to help
[GITA:2179] him overcome his distress and doubts. The dropping of weapons by Arjuna
[GITA:2180] is equivalent to one abdicating one’s responsibility. At this stage, the
[GITA:2181] following points are worth noting: Duryodhana was also distressed after
[GITA:2182] looking at the Pandavas’ army but there is a big difference between the
[GITA:2183] distress of Duryodhana and that of Arjuna. Duryodhana was distressed at
[GITA:2184] the thought of not being able to win the war and thereby usurp  the
[GITA:2185] Pandavas share of the kingdom  illegally. On the other hand, Arjuna’s
[GITA:2186] distress was out of compassion towards his loved ones. Duryodhana shows
[GITA:2187] no such compassion. Arju na was not afraid of fighting as he had fought
[GITA:2188] many wars before and  had won them. But this time it was different. His
[GITA:2189] enemies were people he cared for dearly.

[GITA:2208] Chapter 2 – The Path of Doctrines
[GITA:2210] Chapter Introduction: This chapter of 72 verses is termed Sankhya
[GITA:2211] Yoga (The Path of Doctrines) . In this chapter, the Lord answers Arjuna’s
[GITA:2212] basic questions about the purpose of life and other related philosophical
[GITA:2213] concepts. S ensing that Arjuna’s reservations about fighting the war were
[GITA:2214] due to his fear of losing his loved ones, the Lord delves into the nature of
[GITA:2215] individual souls, the indestructibility of souls, the relationship between
[GITA:2216] individual souls and  Himself.  He  reminds Arjuna that He gave human
[GITA:2217] forms to individual souls to help them in their spiritual journey and that
[GITA:2218] everyone must play their duti ful role in society. In verses 2.12 to 2.39 , the
[GITA:2219] Lord lectures on the nature of individual souls and the Supreme soul (Lord
[GITA:2220] Almighty). In verse 2.39 , the Lord tells Arjuna how to acquire divine,
[GITA:2221] spiritual knowledge which is explained in brief in verses 2.45 to 2.51 . In
[GITA:2222] these verses, the Lord discusses the concept of nishkama karma , that is ,
[GITA:2223] performing prescribed duties without ex pectations.  The Lord urges Arjuna
[GITA:2224] not to despair over the hurt that may be caused to his elders and teachers in
[GITA:2225] the war, as they had chosen to support  the evil king Duryodhana and
[GITA:2226] reminds Arjuna that he had an obligation to fight th is just war to protect his
[GITA:2227] citizens. Lord Krishna teaches Arjuna to focus on performing his
[GITA:2228] prescribed duty of protecting his citizens as an offering to the Lord
[GITA:2229] Almighty and not let his emotions come in the way. Chapter 2 can be
[GITA:2230] considered the foundational chapter  of the entire  Gita as it answers
[GITA:2231] Arjuna’s (and through Arjuna, everyone’s) basic questions about the
[GITA:2232] purpose of life. The remaining chapters serve to expand on the concepts
[GITA:2233] presented in this chapter.

[GITA:2270] Comments: By stating that Arjuna is uttering words unworthy of

[GITA:2282] figurative meanings. In verse 1.47, it was noted that Arjuna was sitting still
[GITA:2283] in his chariot, refusing to wage the war. Now Krishna is directing Arjuna to
[GITA:2295] Chapter 2                                                                                                                                      39

[GITA:2299] Parantapa (destroyer of enemies), to remind him that he has waged and
[GITA:2300] won many wars earlier and need not be afraid to fight this war.

[GITA:2325] Comments: Arjuna argues that it is not worth winning the war which
[GITA:2326] would entail killing his elders and teachers who are pious and God fearing,
[GITA:2327] as that would not lead to any  joy in this world and would bring difficulties
[GITA:2328] hereafter also. A better option  would be to give up fighting and live by

[GITA:2350] Comments: Arjuna argues that if he wins the war by killing the
[GITA:2351] Kauravas, it is in a way equivalent to losing, as the war would also entail
[GITA:2352] the death of many near and dear ones. Arjuna, thus is not able to decide the
[GITA:2353] better option.  Prior to this verse, Arjuna seemed to have made up his mind
[GITA:2354] that he would not wage the war, but now after reflec ting on Krishna’s
[GITA:2355] advice he is  weighing both the options.

[GITA:2391] him accruing  enough good credits to  become the leader of heavens, he

[GITA:2408] term ‘ha’ which indicates surprise. Sanjaya seems to be indicating that it

[GITA:2447] not have been grieving  over their impending death. Krishna uses the word
[GITA:2448] ‘Prajnaavada’ which has two meanings – one who says whatever that
[GITA:2449] comes to one’s mind and secondly, one whose words are not acceptable to

[GITA:2459] Comments: Krishna goes on to answer three conflicts in Arjuna’s
[GITA:2460] mind which are causing him distress. Is the distress due to a fear  of the loss
[GITA:2461] of souls of loved ones? Or is it due to a fear of the loss of their physical
[GITA:2462] bodies? Or is it due to a fear of the loss of their bodies which are equated to
[GITA:2463] their souls?
[GITA:2465] He answers the first question in this verse where he categorically
[GITA:2466] states that souls are eternal and have no beginning or end. This applies to
[GITA:2478] Chapter 2                                                                                                                                      43
[GITA:2480] Arjuna, to all kings assembled at the warfront (and by extension everyone)
[GITA:2481] and especially to the Lord Almighty, which is indicated using the word ‘tu’.
[GITA:2483] The fact that the Lord is espec ially eternal is supported by scriptures
[GITA:2484] such as Katha Upanishad  (2.5.13) which describes the Lord as ‘ nityo
[GITA:2485] nityanam’ (He is eternal among eternals). While the individual souls are
[GITA:2486] eternal, the Lord’s eternality is superior to that of individual souls. Li ving
[GITA:2487] beings whose souls are eternal do undergo creation and destruction of their
[GITA:2488] physical bodies (birth and death), but the Lord who has a transcendental
[GITA:2489] body does not experience creation or destruction. Hence, He is said to have
[GITA:2490] superior eternality compar ed to individual souls. The other two question s
[GITA:2491] are answered in later verses 2.13 and 2.20.
[GITA:2493] A question that arises at this stage is - how could Arjuna, himself a
[GITA:2494] realized soul as an incarnation of deity Devendra, the king of all deities,
[GITA:2495] harbour such doub ts about the nature of the Lord?  Sri Madhwacharya
[GITA:2496] answers this question  [GTN] by stating that the Lord in the form of
[GITA:2497] Vedavyasa in the great epic Mahabharata elaborates the sermon in more
[GITA:2498] detail for the benefit of humanity.

[GITA:2503] Just as one experiences childhood, youth, and old age, one similarly

[GITA:2505] over the loss of the physical body. (2.13)
[GITA:2507] Comments: While the verse 2.12  deals with the issue of a soul’s
[GITA:2508] nature, in this verse the Lord describes the nature of one’s physical body.
[GITA:2509] Just as one goes through changes in the physical body in one’s lifetime,
[GITA:2510] death is inevitable in the end. Hence Arjuna has no rea son to grieve over
[GITA:2511] the loss of the physical bodies of his loved ones in a just war.

[GITA:2531] Do sense organs and sensory objects cause one to exper ience cold or
[GITA:2532] heat, happiness, or sadness? No. One experiences temporary happiness or
[GITA:2533] sadness when these are accompanied by attachment. O Bharata! Rid
[GITA:2534] yourself of attachment which is the real reason for happiness or sadness.
[GITA:2535] (2.14)
[GITA:2537] Comments: If Arjuna’s d istress is due to him not being able to
[GITA:2538] interact with his near and dear ones after they die in war, the Lord states
[GITA:2539] that such distress is due to attachment. Interaction of sense organs with
[GITA:2540] sensory objects do es not in itself  cause happiness or sadness. It is only
[GITA:2541] when such interaction is accompanied by attachment to the physical body
[GITA:2542] does one experience happiness or sadness. Krishna uses the example of
[GITA:2543] heat and cold as sensory objects that cause pleasure or misery when they
[GITA:2544] encounter one’s skin (the only se nse organ that covers one’s entire body).
[GITA:2545] A cool breeze in summer may cause pleasure but the same breeze in winter
[GITA:2546] would cause discomfort. The difference is because of one’s attachment to
[GITA:2547] the body. A gain, when one is asleep one does not feel distress in th e
[GITA:2548] presence of an object that would emit an unpleasant sound. However, when
[GITA:2549] that person is awake the same sound would be objectionable. Krishna
[GITA:2550] advises Arjuna to wage the just war and rid himself of attachment to his
[GITA:2551] loved ones which is causing him distress.

[GITA:2573] Comments: Arjuna could argue that one way for him to avoid
[GITA:2574] distress would be to avoid waging the war which could result in loss of
[GITA:2575] loved ones. In this case, the issue of attachment does not arise. So, why not
[GITA:2576] avoid the war? Lord Krishna says tha t waging a just war is Arjuna’s duty
[GITA:2577] and the way that Arjuna can avoid distress is by ridding himself of
[GITA:2578] attachment to his near and dear ones. Such an action will also result in
[GITA:2579] Arjuna achieving liberation hereafter.

[GITA:2584] No good comes out of bad deeds. Also, there are no bad results from
[GITA:2585] good deeds. The learned seers who have realized the Lord Almighty are
[GITA:2586] convinced of these two facts. (2.16)
[GITA:2588] Comments: Arjuna has expressed concern that he will incur sins by
[GITA:2589] killing elders and teachers during the war. However, these elders are on the
[GITA:2590] side of evil and it is Arjuna’s duty to fight for justice. In this verse, Krishna
[GITA:2591] says that no sin is incurred by performing good deeds.
[GITA:2593] There is a second meaning to this verse as stated by Sri Rayaru
[GITA:2594] [GV]- Inert nature is not subject to creation and destruction , and hence is
[GITA:2595] eternal. The Lord Almighty is also eternal and indestructible.  These two
[GITA:2596] concepts have been traditionally taught by knowledgeable seers.
[GITA:2598] How can one say that inert matter and the Lord Almighty are eternal,
[GITA:2599] and not subject to creation and dissolution? Sri Rayaru [GV] provides an
[GITA:2600] answer by referring to the first line of this verse where  - asat refers to
[GITA:2601] prime material natur e, sat refers to the Lord Almighty , abhava refers to
[GITA:2602] prag abhava  and pradhwamsa abhava , and na vidyate  means ‘does not
[GITA:2603] exist’. This means that prime matter and the Lord Almighty do not have the
[GITA:2604] conditions of the above abhava twins. Thus, the two entities a re said to be
[GITA:2605] eternal.
[GITA:2618] 46                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:2619] What are the abhava twins? This can be explained with an example.
[GITA:2620] Before a potter creates a pot out of clay, the pot is said to have the
[GITA:2621] condition of prior non -existence ( prag abhava ). When such a pot is
[GITA:2622] destroyed, the pot is in th e condition of post non -existence ( pradhwamsa
[GITA:2623] abhava). The material cause for the creation of the universe is inert nature.
[GITA:2624] The Lord Almighty is the instrumental cause for the creation of the
[GITA:2625] universe. Inert nature and the Lord Almighty are not subject to the
[GITA:2626] conditions of prior non -existence (prag abhava ) and post non -existence
[GITA:2627] (pradhwamsa abhava), and thus are not subject to creation or destruction.
[GITA:2629] Sri Rayaru [GV] quotes Sri Narahari Teertha [GBBPN] who in his
[GITA:2630] commentary on the  Gita had an additional i nterpretation for the use of the
[GITA:2631] word ‘api’ (meaning ‘also’) in this verse. This word when combined with
[GITA:2632] the phrase ‘learned seers’, implies that the eternality of inert nature and the
[GITA:2633] Lord Almighty is known through the traditional teachings of learned see rs
[GITA:2634] and through scriptural evidence from the epic Vishnu Purana.
[GITA:2636] Sri Vishwesha Teertha in his Gita Saroddhara [GS] provides a third
[GITA:2637] interpretation for the first line in this verse by applying the concept s to
[GITA:2638] living beings – the p hysical body that is subject to birth  is not perishable
[GITA:2639] (as it is perishable) and the unborn soul does not perish.

[GITA:2672] O Bharata! It is said that the eternal soul’s visible physical body is
[GITA:2673] perishable, but the Lord Almighty, the Supreme Soul, is imperishable (not
[GITA:2674] subject to four-way destruction). Hence , fight this war  as worship to the
[GITA:2675] indwelling Lord Aprameya, the one who is not limited by space, time, or
[GITA:2676] attributes. (2.18)
[GITA:2678] Comments: The individual soul is a reflection of the Lord as in a
[GITA:2679] mirror. Some argue that when the mirror which they consider is upadhi (the
[GITA:2680] conditioning medium) is destroyed, the reflection no longer exists. Sri
[GITA:2681] Rayaru [GV] explains that the upadhi in the example of a reflection in the
[GITA:2682] mirror is the intrinsic body of the individual soul and not the physical body.
[GITA:2683] The intrinsic body ( swaroopa deha)  of a soul never perishes. The Lord is
[GITA:2684] eternal, has no blemishes, does not experience decay or destruction of
[GITA:2685] body, as His body is transcendental. The individual soul’s intrinsic body is
[GITA:2686] also indestructible, and  in that sense, the individual soul is deemed  to have
[GITA:2687] some similarity with the Lord. Hence the intrinsic body of the individual
[GITA:2688] soul is the upadhi in the example of comparing the Lord and the individual
[GITA:2689] soul to the original and the mirror reflection. Also, if the Lord Almighty
[GITA:2690] and individual souls ha ve similar attributes such as indestructibility, then
[GITA:2691] why should one perform duties as a worship to the Lord? Firstly, the
[GITA:2692] individual soul is dependent on the Lord and secondly, the Lord has special
[GITA:2693] characteristics far and beyond those of individual souls.  The Lord pervades
[GITA:2694] everywhere. Sri Rayaru also states [GV] that the Lord is not subject to the
[GITA:2695] fourfold destruction – (i) of the body  (as His body is transcendental), (ii) of
[GITA:2696] the soul (as He is eternal), (iii) of attributes (as He is full of infinite
[GITA:2697] auspicious attributes and is devoid of any blemishes) and (iv) of happiness
[GITA:2698] (as He is devoid of misery). He is superior to ind ividual souls and hence is
[GITA:2699] worthy of worship.

[GITA:2720] Comments: Arjuna’s distress is premised o n his assumption that he
[GITA:2721] may kill his elders and teachers in the war. However, no one can
[GITA:2722] independently kill someone or get killed by someone. Further, no one
[GITA:2723] experiences destruction of their soul, and the Lord is the only independent

[GITA:2739] Krishna are eternal, and from time to time He manifests Himself and makes
[GITA:2740] Himself visible or invisible. The aspect of the Lord manifesting and making
[GITA:2741] Himself visible is generally termed as His birth.
[GITA:2743] Many scriptures have references to the Lord being in the womb of
[GITA:2744] His mother (for example Krishna being in the womb of Devaki) before
[GITA:2745] being born. The Lord’s existence in the womb is incidental to the storyline
[GITA:2757] Chapter 2                                                                                                                                      49
[GITA:2759] where the Lord continues to exist with infinite auspicious attributes and His
[GITA:2760] condition is not like that of mortals who suffer in their mother’s womb.

[GITA:2765] O Partha! One who knows that the soul is eternal, that it does not

[GITA:2767] someone and/or kill someone. (2.21)
[GITA:2769] Comments: The word ‘vinasha’ also means weakness such as hatred
[GITA:2770] which is caused by attachment. The soul does not have these defects
[GITA:2771] intrinsically, but a person gets them due to attachment. A wise person who
[GITA:2772] does not have such defects ( avinashi) will know the true nature of
[GITA:2773] individual souls and the Supreme Soul and will know that no one can cause
[GITA:2774] death to someone else.

[GITA:2782] Comments: In this verse, there is further confirmation on the
[GITA:2783] separation of the soul and the physical body. In verse 2.13, it was stated
[GITA:2784] that a soul experiences transformation i n a physical body as a person
[GITA:2785] transitions through childhood, youth, adulthood, and old age. However, that
[GITA:2786] was related to the same physical body. In this verse, it is clarified that the
[GITA:2787] same soul will migrate from a decayed body to a new body, just as one
[GITA:2788] discards old, worn-out clothes and replaces them with new, good clothes.

[GITA:2808] Comments: While it was made clear that the intrinsic body of a soul
[GITA:2809] does not decay or get destroyed over time, some can question whether it
[GITA:2810] would be possible to harm or destroy a soul with physical elements such as
[GITA:2811] weapons (made from mining earth), fire, water, wind etc. In this verse it is
[GITA:2812] clarified that it is not possible to harm or destroy a soul by any of these
[GITA:2813] means. Further, as clarified by Sri Rayaru [GV], it is also not possible to
[GITA:2814] destroy a soul through a curse (as in th e episode of Daksha Prajapati
[GITA:2815] having his head chopped off due to a curse, there was no destruction of his
[GITA:2816] soul).

[GITA:2871] Comments: The soul does not perish. However, Arjuna could argue
[GITA:2872] that the loss of the physical bodies of dear one s can also cause  grief, as he
[GITA:2873] would not be able to see them. Verse 2.27 answers this question by stating
[GITA:2874] that birth and death of physical bodies is inevitable for everyone and there
[GITA:2875] is no point in grieving over this issue that has no solution.

[GITA:2896] Comments: While it was made clear that everyone experiences birth
[GITA:2897] and death due to their physical bodies, what causes birth and death? This
[GITA:2898] verse reveals that birth and death are caused by interaction with material
[GITA:2899] nature. The physical body is made up of a certain proportion of the five
[GITA:2900] basic elements of nature. When a soul gets a body from material nature it is
[GITA:2901] termed as birth, and when it loses the body and is back to material nature, it
[GITA:2902] is termed as death. A soul that is dependent on the Lord has no control over
[GITA:2903] the process of birth and death. So, it is not worth grieving over such a
[GITA:2904] temporary body.
[GITA:2906] After conquering the snake Kalinga, Krishna and other yadavas were
[GITA:2907] spending a night in the forest. They were faced with the onset of rapidly
[GITA:2908] approaching forest fire. Lord Krishna extinguishe d this fire by swallowing
[GITA:2909] it. Saint Sri Vadiraja [RV] describes this incident to explain the fact that all
[GITA:2910] elements of nature emanate from the Lord and submerge back into Him.

[GITA:2919] Comments: While it was made clear previously that individual souls
[GITA:2920] are not independent, one can ask who they are dependent on. This verse
[GITA:2921] explains that the sole indepe ndent entity in the universe is the Lord
[GITA:2922] Almighty. It also answers that there are no other independent entities that
[GITA:2923] can equal the Lord. While many people can claim to know the attributes of
[GITA:2924] the Lord, this verse makes it clear that only some visualize the Lord with
[GITA:2925] amazement. Just as one cannot find any comparison to the sky or the ocean,
[GITA:2926] no one can find any comparison to the Lord. He is truly incomparable. For
[GITA:2927] one to get over grief that may arise from any activity, one must focus on
[GITA:2928] performing one’s duty as an offering to the Lord. So, it is important for one
[GITA:2929] to appreciate the true greatness of the Lord.

[GITA:2949] is no need to grieve over anyone. (2.30)
[GITA:2951] Comments: In verse 2.12 , it was stated that the individual souls are
[GITA:2952] also by their nature eternal.  How then can one say that they are dependent
[GITA:2953] on the Lord? Sri Rayaru [GV] explains that the Lord protects and controls
[GITA:2954] all bodies that envelope an individual soul, namely – the intrinsic body
[GITA:2955] (swaroopa deha), the subtle body ( linga deha) and the gross physical body
[GITA:2956] (sthoola deha ). This ver se thus explains another aspect of the Lord’s

[GITA:2968] Comments: In verse 1.29 , Arjuna had said that he was trembling as
[GITA:2969] he was overcome with grief. In this verse, the Lord resp onds to that
[GITA:2970] condition. Previously He had declared that Arjuna need not grieve over the
[GITA:2971] loss of near and dear ones as their souls never perish. Now Krishna says
[GITA:2972] that in addition, it is Arjuna’s compulsory duty to fight the Kauravas to end
[GITA:2973] their misrule and  there is nothing more important than this. Thus, there is
[GITA:2974] absolutely no need for Arjuna to feel weak and helpless.

[GITA:3085] whether it was better for the Pandavas to win the war or for the Kauravas to

[GITA:3087] Arjuna’s reputation for backing away from a just war, Krishna now goes on
[GITA:3088] to convince him that he is in a win -win situation and has nothing to lose by
[GITA:3089] fighting the war. If Arjuna were to win this war, he would get back the
[GITA:3090] kingdom and reach heavens hereafter for adhering to his duties. If he were
[GITA:3091] to lose the war and die, he would surely reach the heavens for his effo rts in

[GITA:3156] positive results. Any sincere effort will please the Lord and through His
[GITA:3157] grace one will be able to achieve spiritual awakening.

[GITA:3174] O Scion of the Kuru Dynasty (Arjuna)! There is only one tea ching
[GITA:3175] that leads to decisive spiritual knowledge. There are endless teachings that
[GITA:3176] lead the undecided ones to diverse, wrong knowledge. (2.41)
[GITA:3178] Comments: There are different teachings (often contradictory) about
[GITA:3179] spiritual knowledge. How then does one know the true path? Krishna in
[GITA:3180] this verse categorically states that only true teaching leads to proper divine
[GITA:3181] and spiritual knowledge. This is based on evidence from revered spiritual
[GITA:3182] texts such as the Vedas and is realized from following the Vaishnava path
[GITA:3183] which enunciates the supremacy of Lord Vishnu as the supreme of all
[GITA:3184] souls. In the next few verses (from 2.41 to 2.46), the Lord clears any doubts
[GITA:3185] about the true purport of the Vedas.
[GITA:3187] It is interesting to note that the Lord refers to Arjuna as
[GITA:3188] Kurunandana, meaning ‘Scion of the Kuru dynasty who would bring joy to
[GITA:3189] his lineage’, probably implying that most of  the descendants of the Kuru
[GITA:3190] dynasty such as Duryodhana and his 99 brothers belong to the type of
[GITA:3191] people who believe in various, wrong teachings . Arjuna is different and can
[GITA:3192] dispel his doubts and regain the spiritual knowledge he had already
[GITA:3193] possessed.

[GITA:3204] riches and pleasures and believe that they are the end goals of conducting
[GITA:3205] Vedic rituals. (2.42) (2.43)
[GITA:3218] Chapter 2                                                                                                                                      59
[GITA:3220] Comments: As the Vedas can be interpreted in multiple ways, many
[GITA:3221] focus only on the peripheral interpretation and conclude that the Vedic
[GITA:3222] texts teach  only rituals to appease lesser deities, which would result in
[GITA:3223] achieving desired riches and materialistic happiness in this lifetime and
[GITA:3224] enjoying heavenly fruits hereafter. Krishna categorically speaks against this
[GITA:3225] viewpoint and strongly advises that the real purport of the Vedas is to help
[GITA:3226] one a chieve liberation, the state of everlasting, pure and complete bliss
[GITA:3227] (Moksha), and not riches and heavens which are temporary. Using the
[GITA:3228] Vedas only to reach the heavens would be like plucking a flower from a
[GITA:3229] tree, without waiting for the flower to fully transform into a fruit (which
[GITA:3230] represents Moksha).

[GITA:3265] O Arjuna! Peripherally the Vedas appear to describe rituals that
[GITA:3266] result in atta inment of heavenly and worldly fruits made up of the three
[GITA:3267] attributes. Do not aspire for these. Go beyond dualities (such as pleasure
[GITA:3268] and pain). Focus your mind on the Lord Almighty and leave it to the Lord
[GITA:3269] to help you attain your goals and to help you pro tect goals already attained.
[GITA:3270] (2.45)
[GITA:3272] Comments: The Lord continues to teach about the real purport of
[GITA:3273] the Vedas. In this verse, the Lord instructs that one should not focus on the
[GITA:3274] peripheral meaning of the Vedas that appear to provide details of rituals to
[GITA:3275] help achieve worldly fruits. These fruits and even heavens that one may
[GITA:3276] achieve are borne out of material nature which is a mixture of three
[GITA:3277] attributes – sat, rajas and tamas. As such , these are not permanent, and
[GITA:3278] even if one reaches the heavens, one is bound to fall back to earth after
[GITA:3279] expending merits from good deeds. One should detach oneself from yoga
[GITA:3280] (striving for proscribed material entities not already owned) and kshema
[GITA:3281] (protecting proscribed material entities already possessed). The real purport
[GITA:3282] of the Vedas is to describe the nature of the Lord Almighty. One should
[GITA:3283] focus on the Lord who will help one achieve everlasting bliss ( nirvana).

[GITA:3288] The benefit derived from a small body of water such as a well is
[GITA:3289] better derived from a sumptuous water body such as an ocean. Likewise,
[GITA:3290] benefits derived from following Vedic rituals with proper meaning are
[GITA:3291] surely available for one with special knowledge who has realized the Lord
[GITA:3292] Almighty. (2.46)
[GITA:3294] Comments: In the previous verses, it was indicated that the real
[GITA:3295] purport of the Vedas is in understanding of the Lord and not in transient
[GITA:3296] material benefits including attaining the heavens. It was made clear that one
[GITA:3297] who goes by the peripheral meaning of the Vedas and performs rituals only
[GITA:3298] to attain transient material benefits will never achieve everlasting bliss. A
[GITA:3310] Chapter 2                                                                                                                                      61
[GITA:3312] question arises as to whether the seeker who goes by the inner meaning of
[GITA:3313] the Vedas and realizes the Lord will be eligible for transient fruits such as
[GITA:3314] the heavens. This verse answers that question through an example. Just as
[GITA:3315] the benefits available from well water are available from a larger body of
[GITA:3316] water such as a lake or an ocean, one who has realized the Lord by proper
[GITA:3317] understanding of the Vedas will surely achieve transient benefits such as
[GITA:3318] heavens, even when one is not focused on them.
[GITA:3320] Sri Raghavendra Swamy in his Gita Vivruti [GV] provides an
[GITA:3321] explanation for the words brahmana (one who has realized the Lord) and
[GITA:3322] vijanatha (one who has special knowledge) where both appear to mean the
[GITA:3323] same thing. Sri Rayaru says that vijanatha indicates the one who has
[GITA:3324] paroksha (or indirect) knowledge of the Lord and brahmana indicates one
[GITA:3325] who has gone a step further and has realized aparoksha or direct
[GITA:3326] knowledge of the Lord. In that sense, for one to obtain direct knowledge of
[GITA:3327] the Lord, one must first start by learning the knowledge indirectly (through
[GITA:3328] a qualified teacher, studying Vedic scriptures etc.).
[GITA:3330] Sri Rayaru provides a second meaning for this verse, by interpreting
[GITA:3331] the Sanskrit terms samplutodaka and udapana differently. Earlier
[GITA:3332] samplutodaka referred to a large body of water (ex: an ocean) and udapana
[GITA:3333] referred to a small body of water (ex: well). Sri Rayaru provides a second
[GITA:3334] meaning for these terms. Samplutodaka means the ocean that dissolves the
[GITA:3335] universe during the grand dissolution and udapana refers to the Lord
[GITA:3336] Almighty who protects the eternal entities in the universe such as souls,
[GITA:3337] time etc. With this interpretation, the verse can also be translated to mean
[GITA:3338] as follows: Whatever advantage (such as dharma, moksha etc.) is obtained
[GITA:3339] through the Grace of the Lord Almighty who  protects  everything during
[GITA:3340] the great dissolution of the universe, the same advantage will be accrued by
[GITA:3341] a seeker who has realized the Lord through proper interpretation of the
[GITA:3342] Vedas.

[GITA:3364] Never p erform your duties with expectations o f outcomes. At the same
[GITA:3365] time, never think about relinquishing your duties. (2.47)
[GITA:3367] Comments: This is probably the most commented upon verse in the
[GITA:3368] Gita. It answers the question as to the purpose of performing ones’
[GITA:3369] prescribed duties when there is no guarantee of getting expected results.
[GITA:3370] Even if someone does not see any immediate material benefits from
[GITA:3371] performing ones’ prescribed duties, such actions will please the Lord. They
[GITA:3372] will result in one obtaining true knowledge about the Lord and eventually
[GITA:3373] achieving everlasting bliss. This is implied in the first line of this verse.
[GITA:3374] Another question that one can raise is the purpose of someone performing
[GITA:3375] any action at all, as earlier in verse 2.45, it was stated that one should
[GITA:3376] always focus ones mind on the Lord.  The second line of this verse answers
[GITA:3377] this question by stating that in addition to focusing the mind on the Lord,
[GITA:3378] one must perform prescribed duties; otherwise, one will accrue sins due to
[GITA:3379] relinquishing of duties. In addition to the philosophical reasons, we can all
[GITA:3380] appreciate the fact that for a society to function smoothly, every one of us
[GITA:3381] must play our assigned roles with diligence and sincerity. Such activities,
[GITA:3382] especially when performed as an offering to the Lord, will help us receive
[GITA:3383] the Lord’s grace to help us in our spiritual journey. Lord Krishna is
[GITA:3384] instructing Arjuna here that he should not shirk from his prescribed duty of
[GITA:3385] fighting for a just cause, just because he is uncomfortable with the thought
[GITA:3386] of losing his loved ones.
[GITA:3388] Sri Rayaru [GV] also provides a second meaning for this verse. He
[GITA:3389] translates the phrase ‘karma phala hetu’ (the entity responsible to grant
[GITA:3390] fruits for actions) as the Lord Almighty, as He alone can grant someone the
[GITA:3391] fruits. As per verse 2.45, one should not consider oneself identical to the
[GITA:3403] Chapter 2                                                                                                                                      63
[GITA:3405] Lord as the Lord is supreme and He alone can grant one’s wishes. The
[GITA:3406] second interpretation of this verse is as follows: Arjuna! Individual souls
[GITA:3407] can only perform prescribed duties. They do not have the ability to obtain
[GITA:3408] the fruits by themselves. That ability is only with the Lord. Individual souls
[GITA:3409] are quite different and are subservient to the Lord and hence one should
[GITA:3410] never consider oneself as the Lord.
[GITA:3412] Sri Rayaru [GV] also provides convincing responses to many other
[GITA:3413] deep, philosophical questions in his interpretation of this verse. Following
[GITA:3414] is the summary:
[GITA:3416]  Even those who have already realized the Lord have to keep
[GITA:3417] performing duties.
[GITA:3418]  For one who has already realized the Lord, any additional credit
[GITA:3419] from performing duties will result in buoyant happiness in moksha
[GITA:3420] (the level of bliss in moksha is dependent on the innate capabilities
[GITA:3421] of souls, but additional credits will result in  buoyant happiness, just
[GITA:3422] like when milk boils over, the amount of milk does not change but
[GITA:3423] the milk exhibits more buoyancy)
[GITA:3424]  No one is exempt from performing one’s prescribed duties
[GITA:3425]  While this verse indicates that one should not perform duties with an
[GITA:3426] expectation of the outcome, it is not prohibited for someone to
[GITA:3427] perform activities with loftier expectations of spiritual knowledge
[GITA:3428] and the Lord’s Grace. One should avoid expectations of temporary,
[GITA:3429] transient, material fruits.
[GITA:3430]  Although phrases such as ‘swarga kamo yajeta’ prescribe rituals for
[GITA:3431] fulfilment of mundane desires, the scriptures do not mandate such
[GITA:3432] actions for fulfilment of desires.
[GITA:3433]  Major distinction between individual beings and the Lord in the
[GITA:3434] context of duties and fruits:
[GITA:3435] - Individual Beings: Have responsibility to perform duties. Cannot
[GITA:3436] grant wishes.
[GITA:3437] - Lord Almighty: Has no prescribed responsibility. Can grant
[GITA:3438] wishes.

[GITA:3455] O Dhananjaya! On your spiritual path (yoga), perform duties without
[GITA:3456] attachments and expectations of results. The real yoga is performing one’s
[GITA:3457] duties without expectations and with equanimity. (2.48)
[GITA:3459] Comments: From verses 2.48 onwards, the Lord provides more
[GITA:3460] details on the concept of nishkama karma (performing prescribed duties
[GITA:3461] without expectations).  In the previous verse 2.47, the Lord instructs Arjuna
[GITA:3462] never to think of relinquishing prescribed duties. This verse responds to the
[GITA:3463] question as to how one should perform prescribed duties. Yoga is having no
[GITA:3464] expectations of results from duties performed and being equanimous to
[GITA:3465] positive or negative outcomes. These are not two separate definitions of
[GITA:3466] yoga.
[GITA:3468] Sri Vidyasagara Madhava Teertha has provided a detailed
[GITA:3469] description of a yogi identified in this verse as –
[GITA:3471] (i) one whose mind and intellect are transfixed at the feet of the Lord
[GITA:3472] with the knowledge of the Lord’s omnipresence, omnipotence, and
[GITA:3473] omniscience.
[GITA:3474] (ii) one who engages in actions without attachment to the act itself or
[GITA:3475] the fruits of such actions.
[GITA:3476] (iii) one who engages in all activities only to please the Lord and as a
[GITA:3477] service to the Lord.
[GITA:3478] (iv) one who, knowing fully well that everything is at the will and
[GITA:3479] command of the Lord, accepts success or failure with equanimity.

[GITA:3497] O Dhananjaya! Performing duties with expectation of the outcome is
[GITA:3498] very inferior to the task of attaining divine spiritual knowledge. Wretched
[GITA:3499] are those whose motive is fruit of the action. Focus your mind on spiritual
[GITA:3500] knowledge. (2.49)
[GITA:3502] Comments: In 2.46, it was indicated that one should avoid
[GITA:3503] performing Vedic rituals for temporary gains but instead focus on the inner
[GITA:3504] meaning of the Vedas to attain proper spiritual knowledge. In that sense,
[GITA:3505] performing duties with expectation of material outcome is inferior to the
[GITA:3506] task of attaining divine knowledge. This verse answers the question as to
[GITA:3507] the reason for this distinction. One who is focused only on activities
[GITA:3508] yielding temporary gains will realize sooner or later that such gains will not
[GITA:3509] last and will start feeling miserable. Hence there is no point in performing
[GITA:3510] activities with such expectations.
[GITA:3512] Sri Rayaru [GV] also provides an alternate interpretation for the
[GITA:3513] second half of this verse in response to a question as to whether someone
[GITA:3514] who has already attained spiritual knowledge can consider himself as one
[GITA:3515] with the Lord. By interpreting the phrase phala hetava (the one who grants
[GITA:3516] wishes) as referring to the Lord, Sri Rayaru says that even those who have
[GITA:3517] attained spiritual knowledge will not claim identity with the Lord as such a
[GITA:3518] claim would lead to unending misery.

[GITA:3526] best path. (2.50)
[GITA:3528] Comments: In the previous verse 2.49, it was indicated that
[GITA:3529] activities performed with expectations of material gains are inferior to the
[GITA:3530] activities pursued in attaining divine knowledge.
[GITA:3542] 66                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:3544] That technique which steers one clear of worldly entanglement and
[GITA:3545] ushers one towards the transcendental is ‘skill in action’ (karmasu
[GITA:3546] kauśalam). In this verse, some of the special advantages of these superior
[GITA:3547] activities are outlined. It is indicated that one who has realized the Lord
[GITA:3548] will be rid of the consequences of good and bad deeds which is the
[GITA:3549] essential last step in achieving moksha. A question that would arise
[GITA:3550] naturally is about the reason for consequences of even good deeds to be
[GITA:3551] nullified. Sri Rayaru in GV provides an answer. Good deeds are of two
[GITA:3552] kinds – first one that leads to more clarity on divine knowledge and more
[GITA:3553] exuberant happiness in moksha (ishta punya), and second ones (anishta
[GITA:3554] punya) that do not. Credits from good deeds of the second kind must be
[GITA:3555] used up in this world (in current or future births) while credits from the first
[GITA:3556] kind of good deed will be carried forward till one achieves moksha. The
[GITA:3557] Lord categorically states that among all activities, those that lead to
[GITA:3558] attainment of divine knowledge are supreme.
[GITA:3560] Sri Rayaru [GV] provides a second interpretation for the second half
[GITA:3561] of this verse. One can ask the question - If one feels that one can put in all
[GITA:3562] required efforts to attain spiritual knowledge (which is the goal for
[GITA:3563] achieving moksha), why should one perform activities without expectations
[GITA:3564] on material outcomes? Sri Rayaru answers saying that only activities that
[GITA:3565] are performed for the sole purpose of pleasing the Lord and obtaining
[GITA:3566] divine knowledge will lead to moksha.
[GITA:3568] Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha Swamiji in his Gita Saroddhara [BGS]
[GITA:3569] indicates that this verse reflects the summary of entire chapter 2. This is
[GITA:3570] very appropriate as in this chapter Arjuna in verses 2.4 to 2.8 had expressed
[GITA:3571] the conflict in his mind about his course of action and requested Krishna
[GITA:3572] for guidance. Krishna categorically states in this verse that one needs to
[GITA:3573] perform ones prescribed duty with the goal of achieving divine, spiritual
[GITA:3574] knowledge and that Arjuna needs to engage himself in fighting this holy

[GITA:3595] deaths and reach the state of eternal bliss. (2.51)
[GITA:3596] Comments: In this verse, the Lord provides additional benefits of
[GITA:3597] obtaining proper spiritual knowledge (aparoksha jnana = direct, divine
[GITA:3598] knowledge) which results in attaining moksha. One who reaches moksha
[GITA:3599] will not only be devoid of sadness or blemishes but will also permanently
[GITA:3600] escape the cycle of births and deaths. Lord Krishna is emphasizing the
[GITA:3601] permanence of moksha as opposed to the transitory benefits of heavens. Sri
[GITA:3602] Rayaru in GV explains the reason for interpreting the word ‘manīṣiṇaḥ’ as
[GITA:3603] the one with direct, divine knowledge (aparoksha jnana). The word
[GITA:3604] ‘manīṣi’ means incredibly special knowledge, and direct divine knowledge
[GITA:3605] certainly qualifies for this description.

[GITA:3634] Once you develop conviction in spiritual teachings, your mind will
[GITA:3635] become steadfast. At that time, you will be able to follow the path of divine
[GITA:3636] knowledge. (2.53)
[GITA:3638] Comments: In 2.52, it was indicated that one must rid oneself of
[GITA:3639] ignorant viewpoints. In this verse, the questions about what ignorant
[GITA:3640] viewpoints really are and how one could be rid of them are answered.
[GITA:3641] Ignorant viewpoints are those that are not supported by authentic scriptures
[GITA:3642] such as the Vedas. Ones who have developed strong conviction about
[GITA:3643] teachings from scriptures such as the Vedas will be able to rid themselves
[GITA:3644] of ignorant viewpoints without any doubt. They will then be ready to focus
[GITA:3645] their minds on the Lord which will lead to eternal bliss through the grace of
[GITA:3646] the Lord.
[GITA:3648] Sri Rayaru [GV] provides a second interpretation of this verse based
[GITA:3649] on Sri Madhwacharya’s commentary in GTN where the phrase ‘shruti
[GITA:3650] vipratipanna’ is interpreted alternately as ‘shruti visheshena pratipanna’ to
[GITA:3651] mean – one with the right viewpoint based on authentic scriptures (shruti).
[GITA:3652] Based on this, the verse can be interpreted to mean the following – The one
[GITA:3653] who has realized the Lord based on proper understanding of the Vedas will
[GITA:3654] have one’s mind firmly placed on the Lord and will eventually attain
[GITA:3655] moksha through the Lord’s grace.

[GITA:3665] (Stita Prajna)? How does that person talk or sit or walk (in other words,
[GITA:3666] why does that person need to engage in any activity)? (2.54)

[GITA:3681] Comments: This is perhaps one of the most widely quoted verse
[GITA:3682] from the Gita. After listening to the Lord’s teachings about the need for
[GITA:3683] one to perform prescribed duties without expectations, focusing the mind
[GITA:3684] on the Lord and related topics, Arjuna is now curious to know the
[GITA:3685] characteristics of a person who has developed unwavering conviction
[GITA:3686] (tranquil mind) in divine knowledge. It is interesting that he uses the term
[GITA:3687] ‘bhasha’ to mean characteristics instead of the more common word
[GITA:3688] ‘lakshana’. Arjuna, by using the term ‘samadhi’ (state of complete mental
[GITA:3689] concentration on the Lord), has himself defined a characteristic (lakshana)
[GITA:3690] of a person with deep conviction in divine knowledge. By using the word
[GITA:3691] ‘bhasha’, Arjuna is enquiring about the characteristic of such a person
[GITA:3692] when that person is out of samadhi and is engaged in normal day to day
[GITA:3693] activities. References to talking, sitting, walking etc., in this verse here
[GITA:3694] imply normal day today activities. In other words, Arjuna wants to know
[GITA:3695] how the person with firm resolve performs day to day activities (when not
[GITA:3696] in state of samadhi).
[GITA:3698] Sri Rayaru [GV] also provides a second interpretation for this verse
[GITA:3699] as follows: Why does one who has achieved divine knowledge need to
[GITA:3700] perform activities such as talking, sitting, walking etc.? Here the word
[GITA:3701] ‘kim’ is used to mean ‘why’. In that sense it is a rhetorical question. Why
[GITA:3702] should someone who has already achieved the state of samadhi and has
[GITA:3703] developed unwavering conviction in the Lord indulge in any mundane, day
[GITA:3704] to day worldly activities?
[GITA:3706] The Lord responds to Arjuna’s questions in the remaining verses of
[GITA:3707] this chapter which undoubtedly form the core teachings of the Gita.

[GITA:3725] The Lord said: O Partha! One who has conquered mental blemishes
[GITA:3726] such as desire and has focused mind on the Lord Almighty will achieve
[GITA:3727] mental tranquility by the grace of the Lord. (2.55)
[GITA:3729] Comments: The Lord answers Arjuna’s question 2.54, from 2.55
[GITA:3730] onwards till the end of this chapter. For the rhetorical question in the
[GITA:3731] second line of 2.54, the Lord answers in verse 2.69. While desire is
[GITA:3732] mentioned as a blemish that one needs to conquer, this also applies to other
[GITA:3733] blemishes such as greed, anger, hatred etc. Note that desire here refers to
[GITA:3734] worldly desires and not lofty desires such as achieving divine knowledge.
[GITA:3735] Sri Rayaru [GV] explains the special reason for the use of the word
[GITA:3736] ‘manogatan’ (mental) in this verse. Blemishes such as desire, greed, anger
[GITA:3737] etc., originate in the mind. That being the case, what is the reason for using
[GITA:3738] the qualifier ‘mental’ in ‘mental blemishes’? The divine knowledge that
[GITA:3739] one would attain by the grace of the Lord also manifests in the same mind.
[GITA:3740] For the same mind to attain divine knowledge, it is necessary to be rid of
[GITA:3741] worldly blemishes. It is to drive home the fact that  divine knowledge also
[GITA:3742] resides in the same mind that the qualifier ‘mental’ is used in this verse.
[GITA:3744] In verse 2.39, the Lord started out saying that He would teach the
[GITA:3745] path (yoga) to obtain divine knowledge. However, in this verse, He is
[GITA:3746] teaching the characteristics of a yogi who has already attained divine
[GITA:3747] knowledge. How can this be reconciled? Sri Rayaru [GV] states that for a
[GITA:3748] seeker interested in traversing the path towards divine knowledge, it is
[GITA:3749] important to learn about the characteristics of yogis who have already
[GITA:3750] successfully traversed that path.

[GITA:3772] Comments: In the next 3 verses, the Lord provides more details on
[GITA:3773] the characteristics of a person with mental tranquility. In 2.55, worldly
[GITA:3774] desire was mentioned as example of a blemish. Here that concept is
[GITA:3775] extended to include other blemishes such as obsession, fear, and anger.

[GITA:3784] Comments: The reason for this equanimity in both pleasure and
[GITA:3785] discomfort in such a person is the lack of attachment to worldly issues.
[GITA:3787] The previous verse 2.56 identified the absence of anger as one of the
[GITA:3788] characteristics of a person with mental tranquility and this verse indicates
[GITA:3789] the absence of hatred during distress as another characteristic. Sri Jaya
[GITA:3790] Teertha in his PD clarifies that there is no repetition here as the absence of
[GITA:3791] hatred in 2.57 refers to all situations (due to the use of the word sarvatrāg)

[GITA:3825] Comments: The next 3 verses are about sense control. By practicing
[GITA:3826] self-discipline such as fasting, one experiences reduced power in the five
[GITA:3827] sense organs of perception such as eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and skin.
[GITA:3828] However, the craving experienced by the mind to indulge in sense
[GITA:3829] pleasures does not diminish. This can only happen when one experiences a
[GITA:3830] vision of Lord Almighty.
[GITA:3832] Sri Rayaru [GV] also provides an alternate meaning to this verse by
[GITA:3833] interpreting the word ‘rasa varjam’ to mean desires in objects of all
[GITA:3834] sensory pleasures except taste. This means that by fasting one may
[GITA:3835] experience loss of desire in the objects of sense pleasures such as sound,
[GITA:3836] form, smell, and touch but not in the sense object of taste. This can only be
[GITA:3837] overcome when one experiences a vision of Lord Almighty. This
[GITA:3838] interpretation is also consistent with practical experience as when one ages
[GITA:3839] and loses power and interest in seeing, listening, hearing etc., the desire to
[GITA:3840] taste good food never goes away.  In summary, a seeker should strive to
[GITA:3841] achieve control over all sense organs and mind.

[GITA:3866] may be able to conquer their sense organs. In that case why should one
[GITA:3867] undertake difficult activities such as fasting - nirahara etc.? This verse
[GITA:3868] answers this question by stating that sense organs are extremely strong and
[GITA:3869] can exert control on the minds of even learned ones. It is the nature of sense
[GITA:3870] organs to cause turbulence in one’s mind. Hence, one must undertake
[GITA:3871] difficult rituals such as fasting on special days etc., in addition to spiritual
[GITA:3872] studies and try to overcome the influence of sense organs on one’s mind.
[GITA:3874] The sense organs and the mind are inert objects. A question then
[GITA:3875] arises as to how these inert objects can exert such control over each other.
[GITA:3876] One must remember that the sense organs, while inert, are activated by the
[GITA:3877] Lord resident in every soul based on the innate nature of that soul. So, it is
[GITA:3878] the responsibility of the individual soul to try and control the activities of
[GITA:3879] the sense organs.

[GITA:3888] Comments: From previous discussions, it appears that one needs to
[GITA:3889] control one’s sense organs to attain divine, spiritual knowledge. However,
[GITA:3890] it also appears that one needs to have possessed such divine, spiritual
[GITA:3891] knowledge to be permanently free from the control of sense organs. This
[GITA:3892] appears to be a circular argument and hence is logically untenable
[GITA:3893] (anyonyashraya dosha). How can this be reconciled? Sri Rayaru [GV]
[GITA:3894] points to this verse for the answer. One must try and control one’s sense
[GITA:3895] organs while at the same time focus mind on the Supreme Lord. This will
[GITA:3896] allow the mind to move towards concentrated meditation (dhyana) which
[GITA:3897] allows one to undertake difficult sense control tasks such as strict fasting,
[GITA:3909] 74                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita

[GITA:3913] Sri Rayaru [GV] clarifies that for one to achieve divine, spiritual
[GITA:3914] knowledge (aparoksha jnana), in addition to achieving full control over the
[GITA:3915] sense organs, a seeker also needs to conquer emotions such as desire,
[GITA:3916] hatred etc., as described later in verse 2.64.

[GITA:3926] One who keeps contemplating on sense pleasures develops an
[GITA:3927] attachment and obsession with them, which leads to desire in experiencing
[GITA:3928] such pleasures. This desire in turn leads to anger in the event of not being
[GITA:3929] able to satisfy these desires. Anger leads to delusion and clouds one’s mind
[GITA:3930] about right and wrong. This delusion leads one to forget injunctions against
[GITA:3931] forbidden activities. This forgetfulness in turn leads to failure in intellectual
[GITA:3932] judgement. Loss of intellect results in one’s downfall. (2.62) (2.63)
[GITA:3934] Comments: In verse 2.63, it was stated that one should focus ones
[GITA:3935] mind on the Lord while striving to achieve self-control to conquer the sense
[GITA:3936] organs. In verses 2.62, 2.63, 2.64, the Lord outlines the chain reaction that
[GITA:3937] would ensue from loss of self-control and the emotional impact of
[GITA:3938] attachment/aversion or likes/dislikes (raga/dvesha) leading to ones
[GITA:3939] downfall (and eventual fall into hell). Understanding of this chain reaction
[GITA:3940] will help one to develop equanimity in likes and dislikes.
[GITA:3942] The chain reaction is as follows: contemplation on sense pleasures ->
[GITA:3943] obsession -> desire -> anger -> delusion -> forgetfulness -> loss of
[GITA:3955] Chapter 2                                                                                                                                      75
[GITA:3957] intellect -> destruction. Forgetfulness could be of two types. One would be
[GITA:3958] forgetting knowledge about avoiding activities prohibited in the scriptures
[GITA:3959] and the other would be to forget societal norms such as not usurping
[GITA:3960] properties owned by others. As indicated in 2.56, one who has realized the
[GITA:3961] Lord will have conquered these emotions, but a seeker on the spiritual path
[GITA:3962] will have to strive to control these emotions, or else he/she will experience
[GITA:3963] the state indicated in the chain reaction. The primary cause of the chain
[GITA:3964] reaction is the inability to manage raga, and dvesha. This aspect is further
[GITA:3965] explained in the next verse.

[GITA:3981] Comments: These two verses indicate the benefits one would accrue
[GITA:3982] by controlling the emotions of likes and dislikes. The benefits are – victory
[GITA:3983] over sense organs and mental peace. In 2.61, it was indicated that one who
[GITA:3984] has conquered sense organs will attain direct, divine (aparoksha)
[GITA:3985] knowledge. However, sense control itself will not directly lead to
[GITA:3986] attainment of divine knowledge. Sense control leads to mental peace
[GITA:3987] allowing one to practice concentrated meditation. This leads to attaining
[GITA:3988] direct, divine knowledge. So the immediate advantage of self-control is
[GITA:3989] mental peace which eventually leads to direct, divine knowledge in a serial
[GITA:4001] 76                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:4002] manner. It is also clarified that one who has achieved control over sense
[GITA:4003] organs can indulge in sense activities just enough to maintain physical
[GITA:4004] wellbeing. In verse 2.59, it was indicated that one would need to undertake
[GITA:4005] difficult tasks such as fasting to achieve self-control. Here it is clarified that
[GITA:4006] one does not need to completely avoid consuming foods as one has to
[GITA:4007] ensure physical wellbeing. It is possible to indulge in activities such as
[GITA:4008] consuming minimum amount of required food while still exerting control
[GITA:4009] over the sense organs.
[GITA:4011] In summary, the sequence of events that would unfold from
[GITA:4012] achieving self-control are as follows: Self-control (over sense organs) ->
[GITA:4013] mental peace -> concentrated meditation -> divine knowledge ->
[GITA:4014] elimination of sadness (due to evisceration of sins) -> liberation.

[GITA:4019] One who does not have control over the mind cannot absorb spiritual

[GITA:4021] achieve liberation without meditation? How can one enjoy bliss without

[GITA:4024] Comments: The next two verses describe the perils of not being able
[GITA:4025] to control one’s mind. If one can achieve divine, spiritual knowledge
[GITA:4026] through scriptural studies and analysis, why would one need to control ones
[GITA:4027] mind? This verse answers by stating that one who does not control the
[GITA:4028] mind will not be able to practice concentrated meditation without which
[GITA:4029] one will not be able to absorb difficult concepts in the scriptures. Also, in
[GITA:4030] this verse it is stated that one who does not achieve liberation (moksha)
[GITA:4031] cannot enjoy bliss. One can question the reason for explicitly stating that
[GITA:4032] eternal bliss can only be enjoyed by those in moksha. It must be noted that
[GITA:4033] in 2.65, it was stated that when one is liberated, one will be rid of
[GITA:4034] unhappiness. This verse clarifies that in moksha not only will one be rid of
[GITA:4035] misery, but one will also enjoy pure bliss.

[GITA:4053] The mind which follows sense organs that go after sense pleasures

[GITA:4055] This leads to loss of intellectual judgement and also knowledge derived
[GITA:4056] through studies. (2.67)
[GITA:4058] Comments: This verse makes it very clear that even one who has
[GITA:4059] learnt a lot through study of scriptures and contemplation of scriptural
[GITA:4060] concepts will not be able to benefit from such knowledge if one is unable to
[GITA:4061] control the mind and the sense organs. Mere acquisition of scriptural
[GITA:4062] knowledge without exercising control over the senses and the mind
[GITA:4063] amounts to just book knowledge.The mind is easily swayed. If sense organs
[GITA:4064] pursue sense pleasures, the mind will follow them and will sway just like a
[GITA:4065] boat in an ocean and loses direction when faced with strong winds.
[GITA:4067] The example of a ship getting swayed by strong winds brings to
[GITA:4068] memory an episode in the life of Sri Madhwacharya. Acharya was once
[GITA:4069] meditating on the seashore near Udupi when he saw a ship caught in a
[GITA:4070] violent storm. The people on the ship were crying for help. Acharya waved
[GITA:4071] his holy fabric (kavi shati) towards the ship, at which the ship immediately
[GITA:4072] stabilized on the waters and came safely ashore. The travelers on the ship
[GITA:4073] who were  rescued by Acharya were very grateful and offered him precious
[GITA:4074] gems on board the ship, but Acharya was content with just a lump of
[GITA:4075] sandstone (gopi chandana) that was used to tie the ship’s mast. Inside the
[GITA:4076] sandstone was a beautiful idol of Sri Krishna which was worshipped by
[GITA:4077] Goddess Rukmini and Lord Brahma. Sri Madhwacharya carried that idol
[GITA:4078] and installed it in Udupi where it can be seen even today! We can see the
[GITA:4079] relevance of using the example of a ship swaying in the ocean in this verse
[GITA:4080] considering this episode. Our body is like a ship that we are using to cross
[GITA:4081] the ocean of samsara. Inside our body, Lord Krishna resides in our hearts
[GITA:4082] just like the idol of Sri Krishna was inside the sandstone. Just as the
[GITA:4094] 78                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:4095] travelers on the ship did not know the value of the sandstone piece which
[GITA:4096] had the idol of Sri Krishna in it, we too do not appreciate the presence of
[GITA:4097] the Lord in our hearts. Just as the travelers on the ship faced violent
[GITA:4098] turbulence due to strong winds, we also feel great perturbance in our minds
[GITA:4099] due to strong swaying of our sense organs. The travelers saw Sri
[GITA:4100] Madhwacharya and cried for help. Acharya rescued them immediately.
[GITA:4101] Similarly, if we turn to Sri Madhwacharya (an incarnation of Sri Vayudeva)
[GITA:4102] asking for help in traversing this ocean of samsara, he will rescue us and
[GITA:4103] land us safely in moksha.

[GITA:4140] Comments: In this verse the Lord is comparing the i nterests and
[GITA:4141] knowledge of a normal worldly person and a realized person. Most people
[GITA:4142] immersed in daily, worldly affairs are completely in the dark and have no
[GITA:4143] interest in learning about the attributes of the Lord, whereas a realized soul
[GITA:4144] is very much alert , awake, and aware of the attributes of the Lord.
[GITA:4145] Conversely, while most people are focused on worldly matters, indulging in
[GITA:4146] sense pleasure, a realized person stays in the dark (has no interest in such
[GITA:4147] matters).
[GITA:4149] A realized soul is completely immersed in the Lord and has no
[GITA:4150] interest at all in worldly matters. A question then arises about deities such
[GITA:4151] as Indra, Surya, Agni etc ., who are realized souls but have an active role in
[GITA:4152] worldly matters as they activate the sense organs of living beings. If, as
[GITA:4153] realized souls, they avoid taking interest in worldly matters, how can the
[GITA:4154] world function? Sri Rayaru [GV] answers this question by stating that the
[GITA:4155] nature of a realized soul referred to in this verse does not apply to deities. It
[GITA:4156] applies to souls who have achi eved self -realization but are not part of the
[GITA:4157] group of deities who have specific roles.

[GITA:4162] Just as an ocean does not rise with constant inflow of wa ter and

[GITA:4167] Comments: It was stated in verse 2.69  that a realized person has no
[GITA:4168] interest in worldly matters. However, there are instances of such people
[GITA:4169] indulging in sense activities such as eating, hearing, seeing etc. This verse
[GITA:4170] explains this apparent contradiction by clarifying that just as an ocean does
[GITA:4171] not rise with the inflow of river waters, a realized person who indulges in
[GITA:4172] sense activities , purely to maintain physical wellbeing , does not get
[GITA:4173] attached to such consumption.

[GITA:4207] characteristics of a realized soul in respo nse to Arjuna’s query in verse
[GITA:4208] 2.54. This verse is a conclusio n of that discu ssion. Sri Rayaru clarifies in
[GITA:4209] GV that a realized soul will reach the Lord’s abode only after getting rid of
[GITA:4210] the effects of good and bad deeds ( prarabdha karma ). Sri Rayaru further
[GITA:4211] clarifies that the reference to Brahma here is related to th e Lord ( Para
[GITA:4212] Brahma) and not t o the four-faced deity Brahma, based on the use of the

[GITA:4216] Summary of Chapter 2
[GITA:4218] With the context for the teachings in the Gita established in Chapter
[GITA:4219] 1, the actual sermon of Lord Krishna to Arjuna (and through Arjuna to the
[GITA:4231] Chapter 2                                                                                                                                      81
[GITA:4233] rest of humanity) begins in Chapter 2. Seeing Arjuna in  a pitiable condition
[GITA:4234] not wanting to wage the war, Krishna asks Arjuna why he wants to avoid
[GITA:4235] performing his prescribed duties and thereby risk losing respect in society.
[GITA:4236] Such an abdication of responsibility is not worthy of a great prince like
[GITA:4237] Arjuna who had a stellar reputation for fighting for justice all his life
[GITA:4238] (2.2-2.3). Arjuna, who so far wanted to avoid war out of compassion and
[GITA:4239] attachment to his kith and kin, now reasons that Bheeshma, Drona and
[GITA:4240] others are not mere family members and teachers  whom he holds in very
[GITA:4241] high esteem . T hey are also worthy of worship . However, Krishna’s
[GITA:4242] questioning opens some doubts in his mind, and he informs Krishna that his
[GITA:4243] mind is conflicted, and he is unsure about the path forward. He surrenders
[GITA:4244] to Krishna, requests to be considered as a student and  given guidance
[GITA:4245] (2.4-2.8). Given that Arjuna’s doubts are deep rooted, Lord Krishna
[GITA:4246] proceeds to deliver a very detailed sermon to him covering all aspects of
[GITA:4247] life such as the relationship between the Lord and individual souls,
[GITA:4248] responsibilities of everyone in society, concept of devotion to the Lord,
[GITA:4249] transient nature o f life, cycle of births and deaths and many more topics
[GITA:4250] which prove to be a summary of critical teachings from all scriptures such
[GITA:4251] as the Vedas and great epics such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata etc
[GITA:4252] (2.11-2.71).
[GITA:4253] At this stage, one can expect several qu estions as to the context and
[GITA:4254] content of the Gita. Firstly, why would Krishna get into great details about
[GITA:4255] life, the universe, the relationship between the Lord and individual souls
[GITA:4256] and such spiritual issues when all that was needed was some timely,
[GITA:4257] practical advice to Arjuna to get on with fighting the war. The reason
[GITA:4258] Krishna had to get into such great details is that Arjuna had developed deep
[GITA:4259] rooted doubts about his duties and responsibilities , and he had to be
[GITA:4260] convinced about the need to perform his duti es without getting excessively
[GITA:4261] attached to his near and dear ones. Secondly, one would wonder if the
[GITA:4262] battlefield was the right venue for such heavy philosophical discourse
[GITA:4263] which should normally occur in a serene, quiet environment. Again, it is
[GITA:4264] normal for many to seek guidance when they come to a crossroad and are
[GITA:4265] about to implement actions with grave repercussions. These are the very
[GITA:4266] times when one needs proper spiritual guidance. Some would question as to
[GITA:4278] 82                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:4279] how such a lengthy sermon can be delivered when mi llions of soldiers are
[GITA:4280] about to  start a war. Krishna’s conversation with Arjuna ru ns quickly as
[GITA:4281] Arjuna is an evolved soul and absorbs the concepts very quickly. Finally,
[GITA:4282] some wonder how Arjuna who is known as an incarnation of deity Indra
[GITA:4283] could be ignorant  and develop such fundamental doubts about his duties
[GITA:4284] and responsibilities. At the end of Krishna’s teachings, Arjuna responds
[GITA:4285] saying that by Krishna’s grace, his doubts have been cleared, his memory is
[GITA:4286] back, and he is clear about his duties and responsibi lities (18.73). The fact
[GITA:4287] that his memory was back, implies that Arjuna had proper knowledge about
[GITA:4288] his duties earlier but for some reason his mind was covered with delusion.
[GITA:4289] It was the Lord’s Divine Will that Arjuna would undergo temporary loss of
[GITA:4290] memory to set the stage for his doubts and questions , which then gave Him
[GITA:4291] an opportunity to use Arjuna as an instrument to teach the Gita to all of the
[GITA:4292] mankind. Lord Krishna then advances many powerful reasons for Arjuna to
[GITA:4293] stop worrying about the h arm the war could cause  to his loved ones.
[GITA:4294] Firstly, his elders and teachers such as Bheeshma and Drona were  not
[GITA:4295] worthy of grieving for as they had supported Duryodhana, the evil king ,
[GITA:4296] whose army had to be  destroyed to establish order and righteousness.
[GITA:4297] Despite their good  nature, these elders were blind to Duryodhana’s evil
[GITA:4298] intentions and hence were not deserving of sympathy (2.11). Secondly, if
[GITA:4299] Arjuna was  worried that these elders would be  permanently destroyed,
[GITA:4300] Krishna reminds him that the body and the soul are separate , and that their
[GITA:4301] souls would live on. Further, based on the good deeds they had performed,
[GITA:4302] they would achieve  heaven. So, it was unnecessary  to grieve over them
[GITA:4303] (2.12). Thirdly, just as a body undergoes various stages in life such as
[GITA:4304] childhood, youth, old a ge etc, death is also a natural stage for everybody.
[GITA:4305] As such, these elders would die one day or the other , and no amount of
[GITA:4306] grieving could prevent  that (2.13). Fourthly, just as one does not grieve
[GITA:4307] about throwing out old, worn-out clothes as they are replaced by new, good
[GITA:4308] clothes, one should not grieve over a worn-out body that will eventually be
[GITA:4309] replaced by a new one (2.22). Basically, Krishna teaches Arjuna  that he
[GITA:4310] must perform his rightful duties and any excuses coming in the way are
[GITA:4311] untenable.
[GITA:4324] Chapter 2                                                                                                                                      83
[GITA:4326] Verses 2.20 to 2.24  give us a description of the nature of individual
[GITA:4327] souls which are indestructible, and have no beginning or end etc. As
[GITA:4328] opposed to individual souls, the nature of the Supreme Soul (Lord
[GITA:4329] Almighty) is briefly described in verses 2.17 , 2.25 and 2.29. The Lord who
[GITA:4330] pervades everywhere, is eternal, and does not experience destruction of the
[GITA:4331] body (as His body is transcendental), and is full of auspicious attributes and
[GITA:4332] is devoid of any blemishes. He is superior to individual souls and hence is
[GITA:4333] worthy of  worship. One should perform one s prescribed duties as an
[GITA:4334] offering to the Lord without expectations. This paves the way for one’s
[GITA:4335] liberation. Coming to the practical aspects of Arjuna’s decision to
[GITA:4336] relinquish arms, the Lord e mphasizes the need for Arjuna t o perform his
[GITA:4337] prescribed duties, as for a kshatriya, there is no loftier duty than waging a
[GITA:4338] just war. Arjuna has been handed a great opportunity to perform his duty
[GITA:4339] and he should not waste this chance. If he were to withdraw from war,
[GITA:4340] purely out of compass ion to near and dear ones, nothing would prevent his
[GITA:4341] enemies from concluding that Arjuna was afraid to fight, and they could
[GITA:4342] question his valor. Finally, Krishna tells Arjuna that he has nothing to lose
[GITA:4343] by waging the war. If he wins, he gets to rule the ki ngdom and eventually
[GITA:4344] goes to heaven hereafter for diligently performing his duty. If he loses and
[GITA:4345] dies, he will attain heavens for his conviction and efforts (2.31 -2.37). From
[GITA:4346] verses 2.12 to 2.38, Krishna imparts Arjuna knowledge (sankhya) about the
[GITA:4347] Lord and individual souls. From verse 2.39  onwards, He teaches Arjuna the
[GITA:4348] methods and procedure (yoga) for acquiring such knowledge after which
[GITA:4349] Arjuna would be able to perform his prescribed duties with conviction,
[GITA:4350] realize the Lord, get over worldly bondage and achieve the state of eternal
[GITA:4351] bliss ( moksha). In verses 2.42 -2.45, the Lord teaches Arjuna the real
[GITA:4352] purport of the Vedas - that one should focus on the deeper meanings and
[GITA:4353] not get carried away by peripheral meanings. The real purport of the Vedas
[GITA:4354] is divine, spiritual knowledge of Lord Almighty. In verses 2.45 -2.51, the
[GITA:4355] Lord discusses the concept of nishkama karma , that is performing
[GITA:4356] prescribed duties without expectations. Specifically, in verse 2.50 , the Lord
[GITA:4357] categorically states that the best path for one to achieve divine, spiritual
[GITA:4358] knowledge is for one to focus on performing one’s assigned duties as an
[GITA:4359] offering to the Lord without expectations on the outcome ( nishkama
[GITA:4371] 84                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:4372] karma). Such a realized soul  would be rid of the consequences of good and
[GITA:4373] bad deeds and would be eligible for liberation. Among all activities, those
[GITA:4374] that lead to attainment of divine knowledge is supreme. In verses 2.52 and
[GITA:4375] 2.53, it is stated that in order to absorb proper teachings, one needs to
[GITA:4376] cleanse one’s mind of conflicting, ignorant, and inconsistent viewpoints not
[GITA:4377] based on scriptural truths. In verse 2.54, Arjuna asks Krishna about the
[GITA:4378] characteristics of a person with such a tranquil mind. In the 4 verses,
[GITA:4379] starting from verse 2.55 to 2.58 , the Lord describes the characteristics of a
[GITA:4380] person with mental tranquility. In the 9 verses from 2.59 to 2.67 , questions
[GITA:4381] about the nature of such a person are answered. The Lord concludes the
[GITA:4382] sermon in Chapter 2 by stating in 2.72  that such a person will not
[GITA:4383] experience worldly miseries and in due course will reach His abode.

[GITA:4402] Chapter 3 – The Path of Action
[GITA:4404] Chapter Introduction:  This Chapter of 43 verses is termed Karma
[GITA:4405] Yoga (The Path of Action). In this chapter , t he Lord answers Arju na’s
[GITA:4406] questions regarding the paths of duty ( karma) and knowledge ( jnana).
[GITA:4407] Arjuna wonders if there was a way, he could focus on acquiring knowledge
[GITA:4408] (jnana) and avoid participating in the  war. The Lord answers all Arjuna’s
[GITA:4409] doubts logically to convince him that everyone has an obligation to perform
[GITA:4410] his duties to society , and as a kshatriya prince it was Arjuna’s
[GITA:4411] responsibility to fight the just war to protect his citizens. To perform one’s
[GITA:4412] duty, one also needs to be equipped with knowledge and in that sense, one
[GITA:4413] needs to incorporate both karma and jnana in their spiritual journey. Based
[GITA:4414] on ones innate nature, some may be prescribed a path that is dominant in
[GITA:4415] action and others may be prescribed a path dominant in knowledge. This
[GITA:4416] chapter also has an excellent di scussion on the Cyclic Order of the
[GITA:4417] Universe. In the previous chapter, in verses 2.12 to 2.30, the Lord lectured
[GITA:4418] on the nature of individual souls and the Supreme Soul (Lord Almighty). In
[GITA:4419] verse 2.39, the Lord tells Arjuna how to acquire spiritual knowledge which
[GITA:4420] would guide one to perform right actions. In the verses 2.45 to 2.51, the
[GITA:4421] Lord discusses the concept of nishkama karma  (performing prescribed
[GITA:4422] duties without expectations ) which w ould liberate one from bondage. In
[GITA:4423] this chapter, that concept is expanded in response to Arjuna’s questions that
[GITA:4424] appear in verses 3.1 and 3.2 . Thus, chapter 3 is an appropriate follow up to
[GITA:4425] chapter 2.

[GITA:4457] spoke abo ut the supremacy of the path of knowledge over the path of
[GITA:4458] action. Ho wever, in other verses such as 2.37 , Krishna ex horts Arjuna to
[GITA:4459] follow the path of action by waging the just wa r as that was Arjuna’s
[GITA:4460] prescribed duty. Arjuna is now questioning as to which  is the superior path.
[GITA:4461] He wonders whether he should renounce everything, become an ascetic and
[GITA:4462] follow the path of knowledge which would lead him to liberation.

[GITA:4470] The Lord said:  O Anagha (Arjuna, the one without sins)! As
[GITA:4471] explained before, in this world there are two paths towards liberation
[GITA:4472] depending on one ’s innate nature, talent, and situation. Kings such as
[GITA:4473] Janaka (karma yogi) achieved liberation by sincerely ruling their kingdoms
[GITA:4474] (path of action), and sages such as Sanaka ( jnana yogi) achieved liberation
[GITA:4475] by learning, teaching, and spreading spiritual knowledge to others (path of
[GITA:4476] knowledge). (3.3)
[GITA:4489] Chapter 3                                                                                                                                         87
[GITA:4491] Comments: Lord Krishna clarifies that there are two main paths to
[GITA:4492] liberation, based on one’s innate nature, ability, and eligibility. Arjuna, as a
[GITA:4493] ruler, belongs to the karma yogi  class and hence he should perform his
[GITA:4494] prescribed duty of waging th is war to protect his ci tizens. Thi s answers
[GITA:4495] Arjuna’s question in 3.1. It is further clarified in GV  that everyone must
[GITA:4496] follow both the path of knowledge and the path of action. However, in
[GITA:4497] jnana yogis , knowledge is predominant and hence they should follow the
[GITA:4498] path of knowledge a nd in the process also follow necessary activities (path
[GITA:4499] of action). Likewise, for karma yogis  such as Arjuna, the path of action
[GITA:4500] (war, in this case) is the superior path and traversing that path also requires
[GITA:4501] a certain amount of knowledge (path of knowled ge). As such, karma yoga
[GITA:4502] and jnana yoga  refer to the aspect of action or knowledge that is
[GITA:4503] predominant in a person’s nature. This also means that everyone of us
[GITA:4504] should introspect within ourselves as to the proper path for us to follow ,
[GITA:4505] depending on our inn ate nature, talent, interest, and ability. For one who
[GITA:4506] sincerely prays to the Lord, the path will become clear.

[GITA:4513] One cannot escape b ondage from actions just by relinquishing
[GITA:4514] actions. Also, one cannot directly achieve liberation only by performing
[GITA:4515] duties without expectations (nishkama karma). (3.4)
[GITA:4517] Comments: Krishna instructs Arjuna not to avoid performing
[GITA:4518] prescribed duties. There are three reasons that Arjuna could have for
[GITA:4519] avoiding duties: (a) Once liberated (in moksha), there are no compulsions
[GITA:4520] on duties, so in preparation , it may be best to avoid actions (and focus on
[GITA:4521] knowledge) in this world itself; (b) focus on activities might bi nd one in
[GITA:4522] worldly life and lead to expectations;  and, (c) some scriptures say that
[GITA:4523] action comes in the way of attaining moksha, based on the phrase –
[GITA:4535] 88                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:4536] ‘karmana badhyate jantuhu’ (one gets bound by activity – in other words,
[GITA:4537] actions come in the way of liberation).
[GITA:4539] Lord Krishn a responds to the reasoning in ‘a’ by using the word
[GITA:4540] purusha in this verse which stands for one with a physical body (gross or
[GITA:4541] subtle). The physical body is designed for performing actions. Hence, the
[GITA:4542] existence of the body contradicts t he reasoning in ‘a’. The use of the word
[GITA:4543] purusha also implies that one has gone through many births. Just because,
[GITA:4544] one decides not to perform any actions in this birth, it does not mean that
[GITA:4545] they did not perform activities in prior births. So, does it mean  that one can
[GITA:4546] never achieve liberation? This a rgument makes the reasoning in ‘b’
[GITA:4547] untenable. Actions performed with expectations on outcome s do come in
[GITA:4548] the way of moksha. This does not apply to all actions, especially actions
[GITA:4549] performed without expectations.  Hence, reasoning in ‘c’ is also invalid.
[GITA:4550] Even nishkama karma does not, by itself directly lead to moksha. This type
[GITA:4551] of action leads to purity in mind which allows one to absorb spiritual
[GITA:4552] studies, eventually paving the way for liberation.
[GITA:4554] So, the path to liberation is to avoid activities with expectations and
[GITA:4555] perform prescribed activities -> mental peace -> detachment from worldly
[GITA:4556] objects -> concentrated listening, reflection, meditation on  the Lord
[GITA:4557] Almighty -> divine knowledge -> liberation. The process i nvolved in these
[GITA:4558] steps are clarified in the following verses.

[GITA:4563] One cannot survive for a single second without performing any
[GITA:4564] action. Under the influence of the Lord, everyone is always performing
[GITA:4565] some action or the other due to interaction with material nature. (3.5)
[GITA:4567] Comments: This verse further clarifies the real meaning of the
[GITA:4568] scriptural phrase ‘karmana badhyate jantuhu’ (one gets bound by activity –
[GITA:4569] in other words, activity comes in the way of liberation). Some may use this
[GITA:4581] Chapter 3                                                                                                                                         89
[GITA:4583] phrase to avoid doing any activity. The Lord clarifies that it is impossible
[GITA:4584] for any living being to survive without activity. Even breathing is an
[GITA:4585] activity. Even realized souls, as long as they are alive, will keep performing
[GITA:4586] activities as ordained by the independent Lord Almighty , based on
[GITA:4587] interaction with material nature.

[GITA:4595] One who controls actions of sense organs in pursuing sense objects,

[GITA:4598] O Arjuna! The better path for one is to perform prescrib ed duties
[GITA:4599] using the sense organs of action (hands etc.), while controlling the sense
[GITA:4600] organs of perception (eyes, ears etc.) through the mind. (3.7)
[GITA:4602] Comments: One can understand that one must perform some
[GITA:4603] activities for the sake of physical well -being, and it is impossible to avoid
[GITA:4604] all activities. But why not avoid other activities such as performing rituals
[GITA:4605] etc.? The Lord answers this question by stating that one must perform
[GITA:4606] prescribed activities such as performing rituals. This is elaborated in later
[GITA:4607] verses. The point being  made is that mere performing of activities will not
[GITA:4608] bind someone and come in the way of liberation. It is the mental condition
[GITA:4609] with which one performs action that would bind a person.

[GITA:4644] Comments: This verse provides more clarifications on spiritual texts
[GITA:4645] that outwardly seem to indicate that activities will bind and come in the
[GITA:4646] way of liberation. Bui lding on the argument in verse 3.8  that one has to
[GITA:4647] keep performing some activity or the other at least to sustain life, this verse
[GITA:4648] states that the spiritual text quo ted in the comments section of 3.5  refers
[GITA:4649] only to those activities t hat are not performed as an offering to  Lord
[GITA:4650] Almighty. The word yagna used here refers to Lord Vishnu, as the root
[GITA:4651] word gna means knowledge, and Lord Vishnu is omniscient (all knowing).
[GITA:4652] Activities that are performed as an offering to the Lord will not bind

[GITA:4678] Comments: In the four verses from 3.10 to 3.13 , the Lord desc ribes
[GITA:4679] the concept of yagna (ritual sacrifice) that came into existence at the time
[GITA:4680] of creation of humans. Every aspect of this universe including the elements
[GITA:4681] of nature, the parts of a human body etc., are activated by deities who have
[GITA:4682] been given that powe r by the Lord Almighty. One must perform ritual
[GITA:4683] sacrifices to propitiate the deities, who , when pleased will fulfill the desires
[GITA:4684] of the citizenry. The concept of arthavada is utilized here to convey the
[GITA:4685] importance of performing yagna. Arthavada is a logica l construct that
[GITA:4686] simultaneously uses praise ( stuti) and admonition ( ninda) in conveying a

[GITA:4770] universe and if broken, will result in chaos and anarchy due to the
[GITA:4771] imbalances. Living beings come into physical existence through the food
[GITA:4772] chain, which is represented by rice. Rain (governed by the deity Parjanya –
[GITA:4773] Sun) causes rice to grow.  P arjanya, when pleased by the yagna performed
[GITA:4774] by the citizenry causes rain. Human beings invoke  the Lord Almighty
[GITA:4775] through Vedic hymns (as the Lord is known through the Vedas) and the
[GITA:4776] Lord powers humans to perform their prescribed duties ( karma) and
[GITA:4777] propitiate the deities through yagna. This cycle is represented as follows:
[GITA:4778] Rice -> Humans -> Vedic Prayers - > Lord’s Grace -> Prescribed duties ->
[GITA:4779] Ritual sacrifices -> Offering to Deities (Parjanya) -> Rain -> Rice.
[GITA:4781] Yagna, the concept of offering to deities thr ough ritual sacrifices is
[GITA:4782] an especially important aspect of Hindu philosophy and its meaning is

[GITA:4796] Almighty. Even from practical experience , we all know that there is a
[GITA:4797] specific order in natur e that one must follow. We witness every day  the
[GITA:4798] perils of deviating from this order in terms of global warming, excessive
[GITA:4799] rains, floods, earthquakes, pandemics etc. The Gita teaches that everyone
[GITA:4800] must understand their role in the univer se and not waste th eir lifetime  by
[GITA:4812] 94                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:4813] senselessly pursuing sense pleasures constantly. Some can point out to the
[GITA:4814] instances where even after performing the stipulated yagna, one does not
[GITA:4815] see the effects such as rains, sumptuo us harvest etc., and question  the
[GITA:4816] validity of these cl aims. One must note that mechanically performing these
[GITA:4817] rituals will not yield results and they must be accompanied with sincerity in
[GITA:4818] purpose and most importantly, as an offering to the Supreme Lord.
[GITA:4820] At this stage, one may ask a question as to the applicab ility of these
[GITA:4821] rituals to the population other than married householders, such as students
[GITA:4822] (brahmachari), those who have retired from active life ( vanprasthi) and
[GITA:4823] ascetics ( sanyasis). After all, not everyone w ould have access to all
[GITA:4824] material utilities that would be required to perform these rituals. Sri Rayaru
[GITA:4825] [GV] clarifies that yagna has different meanings based on one s stage in
[GITA:4826] life. For example, for brahmcharis, serving their teachers ( guru) is the
[GITA:4827] stipulated yagna. For ascetics who have renounced all m aterial utilities,
[GITA:4828] yagna refers to mental ( manasika) and vocal (vachaka) sacrifices.
[GITA:4829] Studying, teaching, and lecturing about the scriptures is the stipulated
[GITA:4830] yagna for ascetics. For vanaprasthis, performing activities without hurting
[GITA:4831] any living organism co nstitutes yagna. In other words, yagna is mandatory
[GITA:4832] for everyone, but the sti pulated activity depends on one ’s stage in life. Sri
[GITA:4833] Vidyasagara Madhava Teertha indicated the example of s ome saints who,
[GITA:4834] in addition to jnana yagna (sacrifice through knowledge) , dhyana yagna
[GITA:4835] (sacrifice through meditation), etc.,  practice the yagna of writing poetry on
[GITA:4836] the greatness of the Lord Almighty. For them, poetry (kavana) and singing
[GITA:4837] in praise of the Lord is savana (yagna).

[GITA:4862] Comments: In verses 3.4, 3.10  etc., the requirements for performing
[GITA:4863] one’s stipulated duties were described. Previously, it was pointed out that
[GITA:4864] ascetics perform mental and vocal yagna by way of studying, teaching, and
[GITA:4865] lecturing as everyone must perform their assigned duties. A question that
[GITA:4866] arises then is about the case of those who while meditating have reached
[GITA:4867] the state of ultimate consciousness ( asamprajnata samadhi ). In this state
[GITA:4868] they would not even be aware of their surroundings, and they would be
[GITA:4869] fully immersed in the Lord. This verse states that one who is completely
[GITA:4870] immersed in the Lord and has reached the state of ultimate consciousness
[GITA:4871] will by God’s grace be fully contented an d has no obligations to perform
[GITA:4872] any activities. Such a person will not have interest in any matter other than

[GITA:4881] realized the Lord). (3.18)
[GITA:4883] Comments: Everyone has an obligation to perform prescribed duties
[GITA:4884] many of which must be performed at specified times. Is it necessary for one
[GITA:4885] to wake up a person who is in the state of ultimate consciousness to allow
[GITA:4886] that person to perform prescribed duties at specified times? Sri Rayaru in
[GITA:4887] GV answers by stating that, as  per this verse, such a person has no such
[GITA:4888] obligations. Further, that person does not have to wake up from the state of
[GITA:4889] deep meditation and ultimate consciousness even to greet elders, teachers
[GITA:4890] etc., as no further benefits will be derived. Such  a person ha s already
[GITA:4891] realized the Lord and hence has no obligation to perform duties.

[GITA:4927] Comments: Wise emperors such as Janaka have already achieved
[GITA:4928] divine, spiritual knowledge and are destined to reach the Lord’s abode. If
[GITA:4929] so, why did they continue to perform duties? This verse answers by stating
[GITA:4930] that even such people would experience deeper levels of bliss in moksha on
[GITA:4931] account of additional duties performed. In addition, they perform ed duties
[GITA:4932] to set an example to the masses. Likewise, Arjuna needs to focus on duties
[GITA:4933] as he is considered a role model to his citizens. While, attaining nirvana
[GITA:4934] requires one to acquire divine, spir itual knowledge, such knowledge
[GITA:4935] accrues only when someone performs prescribed duties without
[GITA:4936] expectations. In that sense the relationship between duty and knowledge is
[GITA:4937] like the one between a yoke and the shoulders of a person usi ng that yoke

[GITA:5001] Comments: These verses answer t he question that one may have as
[GITA:5002] to whether the Lord has any obligation to perform any activities. The Lord
[GITA:5003] states that He has no such obligation as He is the absolute owner of all the
[GITA:5004] worlds and has no needs. Even then, He performs activities out of
[GITA:5005] compassion to set an example for everyone. The Lord activates everyone’s
[GITA:5006] activities, but H e is not impacted by activities of others; like a catalytic
[GITA:5007] agent that causes changes in other objects but itself does not undergo
[GITA:5008] changes. If the Lord stops performing ac tivities, there is a danger that
[GITA:5009] everyone in society, devoid of examples , may also stop performing their
[GITA:5010] prescribed activities, interrupting the cycle of the universe, resulting in
[GITA:5011] societal dysfunction.

[GITA:5065] Comments: This verse provides further  explanations on verses 3.25
[GITA:5066] and 3.26. Sri Rayaru in GV  provides an excellent explanation on the inner
[GITA:5067] meanings of the terms prakriti and guna appearing in this verse which carry
[GITA:5068] 3 sets of meanings. Firstly, prakriti and guna refer to the Lord Almighty
[GITA:5069] and His 3 attributes, namely, will, knowledge, and attempt. Secondly, the
[GITA:5070] terms prakriti and guna refer to the three types of individual souls
[GITA:5071] (superior, ordinary, and inferior) and their 3 attributes of knowledge,
[GITA:5072] namely, correct knowledge, mixed knowledge, and false knowledge.
[GITA:5073] Thirdly, the terms prakriti and guna, refer to inert nature and its 3
[GITA:5074] attributes, namely sat (piety), rajas (passion) and tamas (ignorance). With
[GITA:5075] these interpretations, this verse can be expanded to mean as follows -Lord
[GITA:5076] Almighty is ind ependent and is the instrumental cause for activities
[GITA:5077] performed by everyone based on their innate attributes using  inert nature as
[GITA:5089] 100                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:5090] the material cause and their sense organs as the instrument s. The attributes
[GITA:5091] of inert nature impact the actions performed by the sense organs. Ignorant
[GITA:5092] ones think that they are performing the actions on their own using their
[GITA:5093] sense organs of action.

[GITA:5098] O Arjuna, The one with strong arms! Learned one s, aware of the
[GITA:5099] distinction in the attributes and activities between the Lord and ordinary
[GITA:5100] souls, know that their sense organs perform their activities as willed by the
[GITA:5101] Lord. Such people will not get entangled in worldly life. (3.28)
[GITA:5103] Comments: The previous verse stated that ignorant ones believe that
[GITA:5104] they act independently, and this verse describes the views of learned ones.
[GITA:5105] The learned ones are aware that the Lord Almighty is independent and
[GITA:5106] causes activity in individual souls based on their innate nature . They have a
[GITA:5107] good understanding of the divisions among attributes ( guna) and action
[GITA:5108] (karma). Attributes here have different meanings depending on the entity.
[GITA:5109] The attributes of the Lord are will, knowledge, and attempt. For the
[GITA:5110] individual souls they are th e innate nature of being superior, ordinary, and
[GITA:5111] inferior. The attributes of inert nature are sat(piety), rajas(passion), and
[GITA:5112] tamas(ignorance). Likewise, the actions of the 3 entities are also dif ferent.
[GITA:5113] The Lord is independent. Individual souls which are dependent on the Lord
[GITA:5114] act according to their innate nature, and inert nature which is also
[GITA:5115] dependent on the Lord undergoes transformation based on its 3 attributes of
[GITA:5116] sat, rajas and tamas. Sri Rayaru in GV  provides two equally meaningful
[GITA:5117] interpretations for the first half of the second line ( guna guneshu vartanta).
[GITA:5118] First interpretation – The Lord’s attributes (guna) initiate actions (guneshu)
[GITA:5119] in individual souls based on their innate nature. The second interpretation –
[GITA:5120] Individual soul’s sense organs (guna) act on sense objects ( guneshu) based
[GITA:5121] on the Lord’s will and the individual’s innate nature. In summary, the
[GITA:5122] learned ones understand that they are not independent and with proper
[GITA:5134] Chapter 3                                                                                                                                         101

[GITA:5148] answers by stating that ignorant ones who are in constant pursuit of  sense

[GITA:5151] naturally inclined to be ignorant can never be transformed. For example,
[GITA:5152] nature includes cruel animals such as scorpions, snakes, tigers etc. It is in
[GITA:5153] their nature to be cruel. One cannot transform them. The natural ecology of
[GITA:5154] the universe requires different species to exist and not all species have the
[GITA:5155] same attributes. The Lord does not interfere with the innate nature of souls
[GITA:5156] but allows them to exist and act based on their attributes.

[GITA:5165] Comments: After discussing the ways that learned ones and ignorant

[GITA:5182] powering him in his efforts. Sri Rayaru in GV  explains that the word
[GITA:5183] adhyatma can be de rived in two ways – atmanam adhikrutya sthitam  and
[GITA:5184] adhikam chaasow atma , and both mean Supreme Lord. Also, as per
[GITA:5185] Brahma Tarka , every activity must be performed as a worship (or an

[GITA:5188] This verse is indicated as the summary of the entire chapter 3 by Sri
[GITA:5189] Madinur Vishnu Teertha Swamiji [BGS]. Given that the backdrop for the

[GITA:5209] ego and expectations on the outcome. What do other s gain by following
[GITA:5210] this? What is the disadvantage for someone wh o does not follow this?
[GITA:5211] Verses 3.31 and 3.32  answer these questions. Those who always perform
[GITA:5212] their prescribed activities without disdain towards the Lord (disdain is
[GITA:5213] thinking that the Lord i s causing them to indulge in difficult activities) will
[GITA:5214] be rid of bondage and will also attain salvation. Sri Rayaru in GV  provides
[GITA:5215] an interesting explanation for the use of the term api (meaning also), in
[GITA:5227] Chapter 3                                                                                                                                         103
[GITA:5229] verse 3.31 . This verse states that anyone who foll ows the path indicated
[GITA:5230] will eventually attain salvation. The use of api implies that salvation is
[GITA:5231] assured for those who have achieved self-realization (aparoksha jnanis).
[GITA:5233] Verse 3.32  clarifies that those who do not follow this path due to
[GITA:5234] false knowledge w ill not only be denied salvation but will be destined to
[GITA:5235] unending misery.

[GITA:5246] Comments: If one is denied salvation for not following the path
[GITA:5247] described previously, why does one not follow this path? This vers e
[GITA:5248] answers by stating that everyone behaves based on their predisposition.
[GITA:5249] Even learned ones are not immune to the effects of attachment and
[GITA:5250] aversion. The intrinsic nature of a soul causes one to behave in a particular
[GITA:5251] manner. Mere controlling of sense orga ns will not be of much help. Verse
[GITA:5252] (3.31) also indicates that one cannot transform others’ intrinsic nature.

[GITA:5257] Every sense organ has natural attachment and hatred relat ed to the

[GITA:5274] Comments: In verse 3.30, it was s tated that one m ust perform one’s
[GITA:5275] prescribed duties as an offering to the Lord and verse 3.31  stated the
[GITA:5276] advantage of such an action. However, verse 3.33  indicated that one’s
[GITA:5277] activities are governed by one ’s innate nature. If so, how can one then act
[GITA:5278] as instructed in vers e 3.30? This verse answers thi s question by stating that
[GITA:5279] one’s activities are modulated by one’s  emotions such as attachment and
[GITA:5280] aversion. Even though it is extremely difficult to control these emotions,
[GITA:5281] one must make a sincere attempt. The deserving ones will surely succeed.

[GITA:5286] It is better for one to perform prescribed duties (in accordance with

[GITA:5289] performing one’s relevant duties as taking up non -relevant duties will only
[GITA:5290] lead to downfall. (3.35)
[GITA:5292] Comments: In the begin ning of this chapter, in verse 3.1, Arjuna
[GITA:5293] asks Krishna two ques tions. ( i) If knowledge is superior to action, why
[GITA:5294] perform any activit y at all? ( ii) Since actions such as waging a war can
[GITA:5295] have negative consequences such as killing elders and teachers, why
[GITA:5296] indulge in such a war? Lord Krishna responded to the first question in verse
[GITA:5297] 3.3 and aspects of  the second question in verses 3.30 and 3.34  by stating
[GITA:5298] that Arjuna should wage the war as an offering to the Lord without getting
[GITA:5299] influenced by emotions. This verse answers the ‘why’ aspect of the second
[GITA:5300] question. Everyone i s prescribed certain responsibilities in a society based
[GITA:5301] on their personal situations. Arjuna belonged to the ruling kshatriya class
[GITA:5302] and had an obligation to protect his citizens. Hence, the best path for him is
[GITA:5303] to wage th is war despite its unpleasant cons equences, rather than shirk his
[GITA:5304] responsibilities and take up some other vocation such as studying, teaching
[GITA:5305] etc.

[GITA:5331] Comments: In verse 3.34, the Lord instructs that one should conquer
[GITA:5332] emotions such as d esire and aversion which lead one to downfall. Arjuna
[GITA:5333] seems to be asking Him which emotion  is the strongest and most difficult
[GITA:5334] to conquer even when one has the right intentions.

[GITA:5342] The Lord said: Desire and anger push one to commit sinful activities.
[GITA:5343] These are born out of the natural attribute of passion. One can never satiate
[GITA:5344] them. They are the greatest enemies of a seeker. Among t hem, desire is the
[GITA:5345] stronger enemy as it is the root cause of anger. (3.37)
[GITA:5347] Comments: In verses 2.62 and 2.63 , the relationship and
[GITA:5348] interconnection between the emotions of desire, anger, miserliness,
[GITA:5349] obsession, arrogance, and jealousy were discussed. Desir e or lust is the root
[GITA:5350] cause for all these emotions which causes one ’s downfall. Anger arises out
[GITA:5351] of the attribute of passion, but desire is the root cause for anger. The Lord
[GITA:5352] uses the term mahashana to describe desire , meaning that it can never be
[GITA:5353] satiated. Everyone knows by experience that cravings of sense organs can
[GITA:5365] 106                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:5366] never be permanently satiated by indulging in them. Even when one
[GITA:5367] consumes very tasty, sumptuous food and feel s contented, that feeling
[GITA:5368] evaporates by the next day and cravings will resurface. Trying to satiate
[GITA:5369] desire by indulgence is like trying to douse a fire with ghee. The fire
[GITA:5370] continues to ra ge. Desire o r lust is the root cause of one ’s downfall and
[GITA:5371] prevents one from achieving liberation. Sri Ra yaru in GV explains that the
[GITA:5372] emotion of desire is influenced by the demon Kalinemi.

[GITA:5381] (3.38)
[GITA:5383] Comments: While the previous verse 3.37  identified desire or lust as
[GITA:5384] the root cause of evil, this verse explains the strength of this emotion
[GITA:5385] through three different examples. Sri Rayaru in GV  explains the reason for
[GITA:5386] using these three different examples. These are related respectively to the
[GITA:5387] three classes of beings, namely pious, passionate, and ignorant. Pious souls
[GITA:5388] can also get enveloped by lust just as smoke covers a fire. However, just as
[GITA:5389] one can see and feel t he fire to some extent even when covered by smoke,
[GITA:5390] pious beings can visualize the Lord even when influenced by desire . So
[GITA:5391] they have the most to gain by controlling desire. Passionate souls are
[GITA:5392] covered by desire just as dirt covers a mirror. With some effor t, one can
[GITA:5393] wipe the mirror clean and likewise passionate souls with effort can
[GITA:5394] overcome the influence of desire. Ignorant souls are under the tight grip of
[GITA:5395] desire just like a womb covers a fetus strongly. Such souls who are under
[GITA:5396] the constant influence of lust can never overcome this emotion and fail to
[GITA:5397] realize the Lord.
[GITA:5410] Chapter 3                                                                                                                                         107
[GITA:5412] Sri Rayaru provides a second explanation for the three analogies.
[GITA:5413] These analogi es are related to the Lord, one ’s mind and individual soul,
[GITA:5414] respectively. The Lord is self -effulgent but when  one is covered by desire,
[GITA:5415] the Lord cannot be seen just as fire cannot be seen when covered by smoke.
[GITA:5416] When a mirror is covered with dust one cannot see the reflection of the
[GITA:5417] original object. Similarly, when one ’s mind is covered by desire, one
[GITA:5418] cannot visualize the Lord. Thirdly, when one is in the very tight grip of lust
[GITA:5419] just as a fetus is covered by a strong womb, one cannot obtain true divine,
[GITA:5420] spiritual knowledge.

[GITA:5429] Comments: The Lord continues to answer Arjuna’s question from
[GITA:5430] verse 3.36 . Does desire or lust i mpact even those who have acquired
[GITA:5431] spiritual knowledge? This verse answers by stating that even learned ones
[GITA:5432] are impacted by the force of lust. Previously it was stated that desire
[GITA:5433] shrouds the three entities – knowledge about the Lord, knowledge about the
[GITA:5434] individual and knowledge about the individual’s mind. Even spiritual
[GITA:5435] knowledge learnt through a teacher can get shrouded by lust and prevent a
[GITA:5436] seeker from acquiring divine knowledge. Lust is never satiated. It is even
[GITA:5437] stronger than fire. After all a fire g ets extinguished once it consumes
[GITA:5438] flammable material in its way. But lust remains unsatiated even after one
[GITA:5439] indulges in it.

[GITA:5457] through these elements that desire clouds one s judgement and leads one

[GITA:5460] Comments: Where does the quality of desire/lust reside in an
[GITA:5461] individual? Lord Krishna previously stated that desire is the strongest
[GITA:5462] enemy that comes in the way of one ’s spiritual journey. So, it is natural for
[GITA:5463] one to look for the source of  desire. After all, if one wants to conquer an
[GITA:5464] enemy, one needs to know the location of the enemy. This verse answers
[GITA:5465] by stating that lust finds home in one’s sense organs, mind, and intellect.

[GITA:5472] O Arjuna (Superior among the Bharatas)! Therefore, you should first
[GITA:5473] control sense organs and destroy desire which can shroud both ordinary and
[GITA:5474] special spiritual knowledge. (3.41)
[GITA:5476] Comments: The Lord continues to provide answers to Arjuna’s
[GITA:5477] question in a logical manner . If desire has its home in one ’s sense organs
[GITA:5478] (including mind) and intellect, how does one control desire? The Lord
[GITA:5479] answers by stating that one needs to control the sense organs to be able to
[GITA:5480] control desire. Desire is a strong force that can shroud both ordinary and
[GITA:5481] special knowledge ( jnana and vijnana). Ordinary knowledge refers to
[GITA:5482] knowledge th at one acquires through study and through teachers. Special
[GITA:5483] knowledge refers to the deep knowledge that one acquires by study,
[GITA:5484] meditation, and contemplation of scriptural texts such as the Vedas,
[GITA:5485] Puranas etc.
[GITA:5487] In the current context, Arjuna’s knowledge is shrouded by his mental
[GITA:5488] weakness due to the fear of losing his near and dear ones in the war. The
[GITA:5500] Chapter 3                                                                                                                                         109
[GITA:5502] Lord ex horts him to conquer his mind and focus on performing his
[GITA:5503] prescribed duty.
[GITA:5505] At this stage, it is useful to understand the concept of desire.
[GITA:5506] Scriptures state tha t there are four aspects to one ’s activities – dharma
[GITA:5507] (right conduct), artha (material riches), kama (desire) and moksha
[GITA:5508] (liberation). There is a discussion in the Mahabharata regarding the
[GITA:5509] relative importance of these four aspects. Vidura states  that moksha is the
[GITA:5510] most important one as that is everyone’s goal. Bh eema states that kama is
[GITA:5511] the most important. Naturally, everyone is curious to find out more.
[GITA:5512] Bheema states that desire can be either lofty (positive) or primal (negative).
[GITA:5513] After all, one  would work towards moksha only when one has the desire
[GITA:5514] (kama) to achieve moksha. So, lofty desires are not prohibited. It is primal
[GITA:5515] desire or lust that entangles living beings.

[GITA:5522] It is said that the sense organs are superior, and the mind is more
[GITA:5523] superior to them. Intellect is superior to the mind and the ultimate
[GITA:5524] consciousness (the Supreme Lord) is even more superior to the intellect.
[GITA:5525] (3.42)
[GITA:5527] Comments: After describing the impact that desire/lust has on a
[GITA:5528] seeker’s spiritual journey and stating that desire is rooted in the sense
[GITA:5529] organs, it was concluded that one must exert control over the sense organs
[GITA:5530] in order to conquer desire. It was al so indicated that desire is an immensely
[GITA:5531] powerful emotion and even learned ones fall prey to it. A natural question
[GITA:5532] that one would have at this stage is as follows – how can one control the
[GITA:5533] sense organs (including the mind)? This verse answers by indicatin g that
[GITA:5534] the weapon to conquer desire is knowledge. As the enemy resides in an
[GITA:5535] individual’s faculties , one must understand the relative importance of
[GITA:5547] 110                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:5548] various faculties. Only then can one conquer desire. To contr ol desire, one
[GITA:5549] must control one ’s sense organs.  To control the sense organs, one must
[GITA:5550] conquer obsession with objects of sensory perception and to do this one
[GITA:5551] must control the mind. To control  the mind, one must be able to control the
[GITA:5552] intellect. But these are all inert entities. How can they help one co ntrol
[GITA:5553] desire? Sri Rayaru [GV] explains the inner meaning of this verse by
[GITA:5554] explaining that the faculties indicated here imply the respective controlling
[GITA:5555] deities who activate the faculties. The relative gradation among the
[GITA:5556] faculties and their controlling dei ties implied in this verse is as follows.
[GITA:5557] Sense organs (and their controlling deities such as Indra) are superior to
[GITA:5558] other organs in the body (and their controlling deities such as Prithvi).
[GITA:5559] Objects of sensory perception (and their controlling deities such  as Parvati)
[GITA:5560] are superior to the sense organs (and their controlling deities).  The Mind
[GITA:5561] (and its controlling deit y such as Rudra) is superior to objects of sensory
[GITA:5562] perception (and their controlling deities). The Intellect (and controlling
[GITA:5563] deity such as Saraswati) is superior to the mind (and its controlling deities).
[GITA:5564] The principle of consciousness (and its controlling deities such as Brahma)
[GITA:5565] is superior to intellect (and its controlling deities). The unmanifest principle
[GITA:5566] (the inert nature and its controllin g deity Mahalakshmi) is superior to the
[GITA:5567] principle of consciousness.  The supreme Lord Almighty is superior to the
[GITA:5568] unmanifest principle (and to all controlling deities). The Lord has indicated
[GITA:5569] many times that one must perform one ’s prescribed duties without
[GITA:5570] expectations, as an offering to Him. This verse gives everyone an assurance
[GITA:5571] that we are not alone in this universe and the various angelic forces that
[GITA:5572] control all activities in this universe,  and indeed in our bodies can help us
[GITA:5573] in conquering desire if we approach our prescribed duties with sincerity
[GITA:5574] and as an offering to the Lord.

[GITA:5600] Summary of Chapter 3
[GITA:5602] This chapter is a continuation of chapter 2, where the Lord provides
[GITA:5603] more details on the concept of duties without expectations. In the first 2
[GITA:5604] verses, Arjuna expresses confusion about the superiority between the paths
[GITA:5605] of knowledge and action. In verses 3.3 -3.9, the Lord teaches that both these
[GITA:5606] paths lead to liberation and the choice of path depends  on one ’s innate
[GITA:5607] nature, talent, and background. The Lord also c autions Arjuna against
[GITA:5608] avoiding all actions as no one can survive without performing some action.
[GITA:5609] The Lord also provides clarification on the nature of duties that are
[GITA:5610] prescribed to living bei ngs. In verses 3.10 -3.13, the Lord introduces the
[GITA:5611] concept of yagna (ritual sacrifice) and the need for one to perform them to
[GITA:5612] propitiate the deities who govern the various entities essential for the
[GITA:5613] functioning of this universe. The Lord explains the Cyclic O rder o f the
[GITA:5614] Universe in verses 3.14 -3.16 where the interrelat ionships among the
[GITA:5615] various constituents of the universe, namely – the individual souls, the
[GITA:5616] deities, inert nature, and the supreme Lord are briefly presented. For the
[GITA:5617] universe to function, everyone must play their designated role in  the circle
[GITA:5618] of life. In verses 3.17-3.21, the Lord teaches that those who have achieved
[GITA:5619] the state of ultimate consciousness  and have realized the Lord have no
[GITA:5620] obligation to perform  duties. Likewise, souls that are liberated have no
[GITA:5621] obligation to perform  any activities. However, t hey continue to perform
[GITA:5622] activities to set an example to the masses. Such souls do enjoy deeper
[GITA:5623] levels of bliss in moksha. In verses 3.22-3.24, the Lord clarifies that He has
[GITA:5624] no obligation to perform any activit y but does so out of pure compassion to
[GITA:5625] set an example to others and to e nsure order in society. Verses 3.25 -3.29
[GITA:5626] describe the manner of activities performed by the ignorant ones and the
[GITA:5627] learned ones. It also briefly describes the divisions and distinctions among
[GITA:5628] the three constituents of the universe  (the Lord Almighty, individual souls,
[GITA:5640] 112                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:5641] and inert nature) in terms of their attributes and actions. Learned ones
[GITA:5642] understand these divisions and are aware that they do not act
[GITA:5643] independently.  In verse 3.30, the Lord summarizes the previous verses and
[GITA:5644] instructs Arjuna to overcome ego  and attachment and  wage the war as an
[GITA:5645] offering to Him. In verses 3.33 to 3.35 , the Lord speaks ab out the strong
[GITA:5646] influence of one ’s innate nature on one’s activities. In verse 3.36 , Arjuna
[GITA:5647] asks Krishna why  one indulges in  sinful ac tivities even when one is not
[GITA:5648] inclined to do so. The Lord provides a detailed response to Arjuna in a
[GITA:5649] logical, sequential manner in verses 3.37 to 3.43 . To conquer des ire, one
[GITA:5650] must control one ’s sense organs, mind, and intellect. These are controlled
[GITA:5651] by an gelic forces with relative gradation  which are working under the
[GITA:5652] control of the supreme Lord. One must focus on performing one ’s
[GITA:5653] prescribed duties as an offering to the Lord and , by His grace , conquer
[GITA:5654] desire.

[GITA:5673] Chapter 4 - Wisdom in Action
[GITA:5675] Chapter Introduction: This chapter of 42 verses is known as Jnana
[GITA:5676] Yoga (The Path of Knowledge) . It is predominantly about the spiritual
[GITA:5677] knowledge that a seeker  needs to perform prescribed action ( karma).
[GITA:5678] Knowledge regarding the individual souls, various deities and the attributes
[GITA:5679] of the Lord Almighty are explained to instill devotion in a seeker. The Lord
[GITA:5680] explains that He incarnates in this world from time to time to establish
[GITA:5681] virtue and to vanquish immorality. K nowledge about the various types of
[GITA:5682] actions – right action, wrong action and inaction are also covered here.   In
[GITA:5683] the previous chapter, in verse 3.8, the Lord ta ught that one must perform
[GITA:5684] one’s prescribed duties without expectations ( nishkama karma ). In thi s
[GITA:5685] chapter, till verse 4.15, some important attributes of the Lord  Almighty are
[GITA:5686] described. Verses 4.16 to 4.23 provide a comparison of nishkama karma to
[GITA:5687] other types of activities with details of the types of nishkama karma such as
[GITA:5688] worship and sacrifice. A central feature of this chapter is the classification
[GITA:5689] and description of the different types of sacrifices  (yagna) or austerities that
[GITA:5690] yogis perform. These are described in verses 4.25 to 4.30.

[GITA:5698] The Lord said: I declared this salvation conferring imperishable yoga

[GITA:5716] Comments: In verse 3.30 , the Lord tau ght that one should perform
[GITA:5717] one’s prescribed duties without expectations as an offering to Him. In
[GITA:5718] verses 3.31, 3.32  and others the Lord indicated the advantages and
[GITA:5719] disadvantages of perfo rming or not performing the duties as stated. The
[GITA:5720] Lord backs up these arguments by providing examples of seekers in the
[GITA:5721] past who have followed the path shown by the Lord and have achieved
[GITA:5722] greatness. The Lord uses the term avyaya (imperishable) to indicate the
[GITA:5723] permanent nature of such divine, spiritual knowledge. So, the reference to
[GITA:5724] deities who over time had acted as advised previously is very pertinent.

[GITA:5732] disappeared. (4.2)
[GITA:5734] Comments: Sri Rayaru ascribes in GV  2 meanings to the word
[GITA:5735] ‘rajarshi’. One meaning raja + rishi = emperors + sages. Second one
[GITA:5736] meaning rajasu rushayaha  = superior among emperors. This is important
[GITA:5737] because Arjuna is also a king , and many emperors, sages, and superior
[GITA:5738] emperors had followed the path taught by Kr ishna, implying that Arjuna
[GITA:5739] should take note of these examples. While that knowledge had passed on
[GITA:5740] from one generation to the next, it had faded  due to the passage of time .
[GITA:5741] Hence the need for Lord Krishna to reiterate them here.

[GITA:5762] Comments: The Lord states that Arjuna is receiving this p recious and
[GITA:5763] confidential teaching as Arjuna is His devotee and friend (Verse (2.7)). Sri
[GITA:5764] Rayaru explains in GV  that the use of the term hi implies two reasons for
[GITA:5765] the Lord doing so-
[GITA:5767]  I am teaching this to you as you are my devotee and friend.
[GITA:5768]  This ancient knowledge is supreme and secretive.
[GITA:5770] The spiritual knowledge taught in the Gita is a summary of the
[GITA:5771] scriptures such as Pancha Ratra that was taught by Lord Vishnu to deities
[GITA:5772] such as Brahma, Vayu, Rudra, Indra, Surya, Yama, the Ashwini twins etc.
[GITA:5773] In verse 3.20, the example of king Janaka was quoted to demonstrate  the
[GITA:5774] practice of nishkama karma  among householders (who have family and
[GITA:5775] societal responsibilities). The three verses 4.1 to 4.3 give examples of other
[GITA:5776] great souls who have benefitted from this knowledge.

[GITA:5786] Comments: In verse 3.30 , the Lord stated that to achieve liberation
[GITA:5787] one must perform one ’s prescribed duties without expectation , as an
[GITA:5788] offering to Him. This implies that the Lord is supreme and worthy of
[GITA:5789] worship. In other verses such as 2.12 , the Lord clarified that He does not
[GITA:5790] experience births and deaths like individual souls.  Sri Rayaru  in GV
[GITA:5791] explains that Arjuna (a jnani himself who had already listened to Krishna’s
[GITA:5792] teachings in Chapter 2 and 3) was not asking about the Lord’s birt h (or
[GITA:5793] manifestations), but about the evidence to prove the difference between the
[GITA:5794] Lord Almighty and individual souls.

[GITA:5815] births of yours have come and gone. O! Parantapa! I know them all clearly,
[GITA:5816] but you do not. (4.5)
[GITA:5818] Comments: By stating that He always has many manifestations, the
[GITA:5819] Lord answers Arjuna’s question in 4.4  as to how He taught the knowledge
[GITA:5820] to Surya who has been in existence for a long time. The Lord manifests
[GITA:5821] (appears) at different time s which are loosely termed as  the Lord’s births.
[GITA:5822] This is quite different from individual souls such as Arjuna who experience
[GITA:5823] many births and deaths. Further, the Lord clarifies that He is aware of all
[GITA:5824] His incarnations and all births of others, but the individual souls are not
[GITA:5825] aware of their many births. Hence this verse draws out the superiority and
[GITA:5826] omniscient nature of the Lord as distinct from individual souls.

[GITA:5834] will. (4.6)
[GITA:5836] Comments: The Lord seemed to indi cate in verse 4.5  that He appears
[GITA:5837] and disappears many times. But in verse 2.17 , the Lord stated that He does
[GITA:5838] not cease to exist. How ca n thus be reconciled? The next few verses detail
[GITA:5839] the concept of manifestation as it relates to the Lord. The Lord does not
[GITA:5840] experience physical births as experienced by individual souls. The term

[GITA:5854] birth (janma) when used in the context of Lord, relates to Hi s manifestation
[GITA:5855] which He does at His own free will using the entities of material nature that
[GITA:5856] He Himself created. This is explained in the phrase prakritim swam
[GITA:5857] adhishtaya. Sri Rayaru in GV interprets this phrase in three different ways:
[GITA:5859]  The Lord, in an incarnation such as Krishna manifests Himself
[GITA:5860] through the bodies of Vasudeva and Devaki which He Himself ha d
[GITA:5861] created.
[GITA:5862]  The Lord utilizes Goddess Durga  (governor of tamasic nature) who
[GITA:5863] is under His control , to cause  ignorant souls to consider His
[GITA:5864] manifestation as an ordinary birth.
[GITA:5865]  The Lord performs the above two actions of His own free will.
[GITA:5866] These 3 interpretations provide answers to the three questions that arise
[GITA:5867] here.
[GITA:5868] Question 1 : What does  the statement that the Lord takes birth at a
[GITA:5869] specific time and place  when His body and soul are eternal  mean? For
[GITA:5870] example, the birth of Krishna to Vasudeva and Devaki.
[GITA:5871] Answer 1 : Inert nature is under the control of the Lord Almighty. The
[GITA:5872] Lord gives physical bodies comprised of material nature to Vasudeva and
[GITA:5873] Devaki and ent ers their bodies in His transcendental form and manifests
[GITA:5874] Himself.
[GITA:5875] Question 2: What makes some think of the Lord as having a birth like
[GITA:5876] everyone else?
[GITA:5877] Answer 2: The Lord causes ignorance in some through Goddess Durga
[GITA:5878] who acts under His control.
[GITA:5879] Question 3 : What benefit does the Lord get by manifesting Himself
[GITA:5880] through Vasudeva and Devaki (and indeed other manifestations)?
[GITA:5881] Answer 3 : The Lord’s actions are due to His free will which is His
[GITA:5882] innate nature and not for any benefit.

[GITA:5909] Comments: If the Lord has nothing to gain by incarnating, what is
[GITA:5910] the purpose of His incarnations? These two verses  answer by stating that
[GITA:5911] the Lord incarnates purely out of His free will and out of pure compassion
[GITA:5912] towards living beings. While the Lord has no obligation to incarnate at any
[GITA:5913] specific time or place, generally He incarnates from time to time, to protect
[GITA:5914] the virtuous whenever virtu e in the society is obscured, and to destroy the
[GITA:5915] evil whenever there is an ascension in immorality.

[GITA:5924] Comments: In every manifestation of the Lord such as Lord
[GITA:5925] Narasimha, Lord Rama, Lord Krishna etc., the Lord has demonstrat ed
[GITA:5926] extraordinary powers and activities to advance the cause of righteousness
[GITA:5927] and to punish the evil. Many times, His actio ns are meant to set an example
[GITA:5928] for ideal living as in the case of Lord Rama. These incarnations are detailed
[GITA:5940] Chapter 4                                                                                                                                           119
[GITA:5942] in epics such as the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, the Bhagavata etc. It
[GITA:5943] must be noted that a seeker needs to have proper understanding of the
[GITA:5944] Lord’s activities. This is implied in using the term tatvata. It is quite easy to
[GITA:5945] misunderstand some of the Lord’s activities by looking at t hem
[GITA:5946] peripherally. One must understand the real intent of His actions. Only then
[GITA:5947] can one hope to achieve l iberation. Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that proper
[GITA:5948] knowledge of the Lord’s incarnations and activities is necessary for a
[GITA:5949] seeker to achieve liberation b ut that is not sufficient. The seeker also needs
[GITA:5950] to learn about Lord’s other attributes such as om nipresence, omniscience
[GITA:5951] etc.

[GITA:5961] Comments: The previous verse stated that a seeker needs to have
[GITA:5962] proper knowledge a bout the Lord’s incarnations and actions. This verse
[GITA:5963] describes such a seeker as one who has conquered emotions such as desire
[GITA:5964] (in material objects), fear, and anger. Sri Rayaru [GV] provides an
[GITA:5965] excellent explanation of this verse as having answered two imp ortant
[GITA:5966] questions:
[GITA:5968]  Are there seekers who have achieved liberation by properly
[GITA:5969] understanding the Lord’s incarnations and activities? This verse
[GITA:5970] describes the attributes of those seekers.
[GITA:5972]  How does the knowledge about the Lord’s incarnations and activities
[GITA:5973] lead one to liberation? This verse answers this question by stating
[GITA:5974] that it is through sur render and devotion to the Lord, one can attain
[GITA:5975] liberation.

[GITA:5989] Arjuna had expressed his surrender to the Lord (2.7) and hence he is a
[GITA:5990] very eligible seeker.

[GITA:6000] Comments: In the previous verses it was stated that one who
[GITA:6001] worships the Lord will achieve liberation. Will all who worship the Lord
[GITA:6002] achieve liberation equally? If yes, how can one account for the difference
[GITA:6003] in efforts and approach? If no, isn’t there partialit y in result? This verse
[GITA:6004] answers these questions stating that among those who worship the Lord,
[GITA:6005] there are broadly two categories. The first one includes  learned ones who
[GITA:6006] perform activities without expectations and  surrender completely to the
[GITA:6007] Lord. These see kers are destined for liberation. The second category
[GITA:6008] includes those who, while aware of the supremacy of  the Lord, perform
[GITA:6009] rituals worshipping other deities such as Brahma, Rudra, Indra etc., seeking
[GITA:6010] temporary fruits such as progeny, wealth etc.  Even though this category of
[GITA:6011] people performs rituals to propitiate other deities, the fact that the Lord  is
[GITA:6012] the ultimate destination for their efforts results in them receiving temporary
[GITA:6013] rewards.
[GITA:6015] In the second half of this verse, the Lord clarifies that even offer ings
[GITA:6016] made by the second category of people will eventually reach  Him, but they
[GITA:6017] will not be aware of this fact. The learned ones who act without any
[GITA:6018] expectation are fully aware of this. Thus, the Lord rewards seekers based
[GITA:6019] on their effort, conviction, and a ttitude, purely based on merit. So, there is
[GITA:6020] no question of partiality.

[GITA:6042] Comments: This verse provides the reasoning behind the
[GITA:6043] explanation in the previous verse that all fruits are ultimately obtained from
[GITA:6044] the Lord, regardless of the de ities who are worshipped. It is seen in this
[GITA:6045] world that one who propitiate s other deities do receive fruits from one’s
[GITA:6046] efforts, but it is the Lord Alm ighty who ultimately grants wishes based on

[GITA:6054] I created the four categories (varnas) of beings based on their nature
[GITA:6055] and activities. Though I created them, I do not have a creator. I also do not
[GITA:6056] have any obligation to act, and I am eternal. (4.13)
[GITA:6058] Comments: It was stated previously that it is essential for one to
[GITA:6059] surrender to  the Lord to achieve divine, spiritual knowledge and attain
[GITA:6060] liberation. This verse explains the reason why one should surrender to
[GITA:6061] Lord. The Lord is like a  father, and children are expected to worship their
[GITA:6062] father. The Lord, who gave physical bodies to individual entities, provides
[GITA:6063] details of the categories of people He creates.
[GITA:6065] This is probably the most controversial and least understood verse in
[GITA:6066] the Gita as many people associate this verse with the caste system in
[GITA:6067] society. The four categories here are based on the proportion of the three
[GITA:6068] innate attributes ( sattv, rajas and tamas) of beings. How can there be four
[GITA:6080] 122                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:6081] categories if there are three innate attribu tes? The four categories are based
[GITA:6082] on the varying proportions of these  three innate attributes. Sri
[GITA:6083] Madhwacharya provides detailed explanations of the categories ( varnas)
[GITA:6084] and attributes ( gunas) in GB and GTN .  Individual souls are basically of
[GITA:6085] three types – angels (deities), humans, and demons. Angels have the quality
[GITA:6086] of pure sattv and are destined for liberation. Demons have pure tamas and
[GITA:6087] are destined for hell. Humans have rajas mixed with varying proportions of
[GITA:6088] sattv, rajas and tamas resulting in satvika rajasas, rajasa rajasas  and
[GITA:6089] rajasa tamasas . Those with a satvik rajasa  quality are destined for
[GITA:6090] liberation and among them are the se four categories . As explained by Sri
[GITA:6091] Jaya Teertha [ND]  – these categories are characterized by the following -
[GITA:6092] (i) sattv is much greater than rajas  (sattv >> rajas), (ii) sattv is somewhat
[GITA:6093] greater than rajas (sattv > rajas), (iii) sattv and rajas are in equal
[GITA:6094] proportion but greater than tamas (rajas = sattv > tamas) and, (iv) sattv is
[GITA:6095] greater than tamas which is greater than rajas (sattv > tamas > rajas) . As
[GITA:6096] stated by Sri Madhwacharya in GB , the qualities of sattv, rajas and tamas
[GITA:6097] are based on  the level of one ’s devotion to Lord Almighty Vishnu. One
[GITA:6098] cannot conclude one ’s innate nature just by one’s family of  birth. The
[GITA:6099] categorization of beings based on one ’s profession or vocation  (karma) is
[GITA:6100] covered in detail in Chapter 18.
[GITA:6102] The four categories of people indicated here are generally known as
[GITA:6103] brahmanas, kshatriyas, vaishyas, and shudras, which also nominally
[GITA:6104] indicates the profess ion that they undertake, namely, scholastic pursuits,
[GITA:6105] administration, commerce, and service industry. All of them are eligible for
[GITA:6106] liberation. Sri Jaya Teertha in his ND  clarifies this concept by stating that
[GITA:6107] Lord Vishnu’s devotees (vaishnavas) are conside red pious because of their
[GITA:6108] higher levels of sattvic attributes, and not due to their brahminical
[GITA:6109] profession. Sri Madhwacharya in GTN  clarifies that the categorization
[GITA:6110] based on one ’s innate nature ( swabhava) manifests in one ’s natural
[GITA:6111] aptitudes such as  steadfast devotion to the Lord,  self-control, valor,
[GITA:6112] bravery, farming, commerce, service mindedness  etc. This categorization
[GITA:6113] should not be equated to the societal classification based on one’s family of
[GITA:6114] birth (oupadika).
[GITA:6126] Chapter 4                                                                                                                                           123
[GITA:6128] While the deities have predominant sattv qualities, Sri Rayaru in his
[GITA:6129] Prameya Sangraha  [PS] provides more details on the categorization of
[GITA:6130] deities. During the process of subtle creation, all individual souls obtain a
[GITA:6131] subtle body called Aniruddha deha. During this time, the various deities get
[GITA:6132] categorized - the four faced deity Brahma as brahmin, deities Vayudeva,
[GITA:6133] Sesha, Garuda, rudra etc., as kshatriyas, many Suryas, some children of
[GITA:6134] Aditi, many Maruts, Vasus etc., as vyshyas, and Ashwini twins, Prithvi,
[GITA:6135] Kala, Mrutyu etc., as shudras. This clear ly proves that there is nothing
[GITA:6136] intrinsically superior or inferior about the categories. They are simply
[GITA:6137] different from each other.
[GITA:6139] In the second half of this verse, the Lord clarifies that while He is the
[GITA:6140] creator of these categories, He i s not created by  anyone. He also has no
[GITA:6141] obligation to act.
[GITA:6143] Notes: Material nature comprises of three qualities, and these are
[GITA:6144] present in all living beings in varying degrees. The three qualities are sattv,
[GITA:6145] rajas and tamas. Sattv is generally translated as pure, virtuous,  pious etc.,
[GITA:6146] rajas as passion and tamas as ignorance.  Those identified with the quality
[GITA:6147] of sattv are generally known to have purity in thought, words, and actions .
[GITA:6148] Sri Madhwacharya identifies an additional attribute as part of sattv. This
[GITA:6149] attribute is devotion to the Lord as stated by Sri Madhwacharya i n his GTN
[GITA:6150] based on Naradeeya Purana . Hence the translation of sattv as pious is
[GITA:6151] more appropriate as piety also implies devotion.  The quality of rajas leads
[GITA:6152] one to be passionate about material possessions and  sense pleasures. For
[GITA:6153] brevity, from now on rajas will be translated as passion. The quality of
[GITA:6154] tamas results in ignorance and delusion and is characterized by excessive
[GITA:6155] lethargy, sleepiness, and indulgence in sense pleasures. Again, for brevity
[GITA:6156] tamas will be translated as ignorance.

[GITA:6174] Actions do not bind Me. I have no interest in any fruits from My
[GITA:6175] actions. One who truly knows Me thus wil l not get entangled by actions.
[GITA:6176] (4.14)
[GITA:6178] Comments: In the previous verse the Lord stated that He has no
[GITA:6179] obligation to perform any activities. In the next few verses, He provides the
[GITA:6180] nature of His activities and contrasts  them with those of individual souls.
[GITA:6181] Actions do not bind the Lord. The Lord has no interest in any outcome of
[GITA:6182] His actions and acts on His own free will. The reason for individual souls
[GITA:6183] getting entangled in actions is their expectations. The one who understands
[GITA:6184] the nature of the Lord’s actions will not be bound by actions. Sri Rayaru in
[GITA:6185] GV provides a convincing explanation for the inherent difference between
[GITA:6186] the Supreme Soul and the individual soul based on the choice of words in
[GITA:6187] this verse. The Lord says ‘ yo maam iti abhijanati ’, meaning the ones who
[GITA:6188] know Me (maam, meaning Krishna) thus will not get entangled by actions .
[GITA:6189] Here, the Lord’s attributes are the subject matter which must be properly
[GITA:6190] understood by others (yo = individual souls) to get released from bondage.

[GITA:6199] Comments: Why do learned ones who are aware of the Lord’s
[GITA:6200] attributes about activities act at all? This verse answers by giving the
[GITA:6201] examples set by  earlier generations. In verse 3.30 , the Lord had indicated
[GITA:6202] that emperors such as Janaka  achieved liber ation by performing their
[GITA:6203] prescribed duties without expectations. Such superior souls perform
[GITA:6204] activities out of two reasons. One, to set an example for others in  society
[GITA:6205] and second, to experience exuberance in bliss (in moksha).

[GITA:6230] Comments: The previous verse taught that a seeker should perform

[GITA:6232] actions and inaction. Sri Rayaru in GV  provides an interesting explanation
[GITA:6233] for the use of the Sanskr it word ‘tat’ in this verse. tat is an interesting word
[GITA:6234] in Sanskrit and its meaning depends on the context. At least 3 meanings of
[GITA:6235] tat are – therefore, that, and from. The interpretations are –
[GITA:6237]  Even learned ones get confused about the concept of karma.
[GITA:6238] Therefore, you must understand it properly
[GITA:6239]  In the previous verse 4.15 , it was indicated that one must perform
[GITA:6240] prescribed duties (karma). It is that karma which is discussed in this
[GITA:6241] verse

[GITA:6247] One should learn what constitutes right action, prohibited action  and
[GITA:6248] inaction, and learn about the distinction between them. All these actions are
[GITA:6249] under My control. The subject of act ion (karma) is extremely complex by
[GITA:6250] nature. (4.17)
[GITA:6252] Comments: In the previous verse, the words karma (action) and
[GITA:6253] akarma (inaction) were used where akarma was also interpreted to include
[GITA:6254] vikarma (prohibited action). In this verse, all three types of action s are
[GITA:6266] 126                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:6267] explicitly stated. S ri Rayaru in GV  stresses that one must strive hard to
[GITA:6268] understand the nature of action, especially since it is an extremely complex
[GITA:6269] topic.
[GITA:6271] Sri Rayaru also provides an interesting, second interpretation of this
[GITA:6272] verse following Sri Madhwacharya’s GTN . The words karmanaha,
[GITA:6273] vikarmanaha, and akarmanaha can be derived as – karma + naha,
[GITA:6274] vikarma + naha, and akarma + naha. The word naha means ‘from the
[GITA:6275] Lord’ (plural). With this de rivation, this verse can also be interpreted as
[GITA:6276] follows – all the three types of action (right action, prohibited action , and
[GITA:6277] inaction) are implemented by the different forms of  the Lord under His
[GITA:6278] control. ‘Different Forms’ is implied by the plural (naha) indicated above.

[GITA:6283] The wise realize that they do not perform activities independently
[GITA:6284] and even when they are not active (during sleeping, dreaming), there is
[GITA:6285] activity being performed (such as breathing) by the Lord Almighty. Such a
[GITA:6286] person is performing duties fully  and will derive full benefits thereon.
[GITA:6287] (4.18)
[GITA:6289] Comments: Having introduced the types of action in previous
[GITA:6290] verses, the Lord now describes these actions in the next few verses.
[GITA:6291] Prescribed duties performed by one wi th the knowledge that the actual
[GITA:6292] work is enabled by the Lord is doing the right action ( karma). The one who
[GITA:6293] performs duties without knowing that the Lord is enabling one to work
[GITA:6294] engages in incorrect/futile action ( akarma). Actions not approved by the
[GITA:6295] scriptures constitute prohibited action (vikarma).
[GITA:6297] Sri Rayaru in GV  provides another interesting, second interpretation
[GITA:6298] of this verse based on Sri Madhwacharya’s GTN. The word karma can also
[GITA:6299] mean the individual soul based on the obligation to perform duties. The
[GITA:6300] Lord is also termed akarma as He has no obligation to perform anything.
[GITA:6312] Chapter 4                                                                                                                                           127
[GITA:6314] With this, the verse can be interpreted to mean as follows – the one who
[GITA:6315] knows that the dependent individual soul has obligation  to perform duties,
[GITA:6316] and that the independent Lord Al mighty has no obligation for duties , is
[GITA:6317] indeed knowledgeable.  Such a person is performing right actions fully.
[GITA:6319] This verse is identified by  Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha in BGS  as
[GITA:6320] being the summary of this chapter. As this chapter is predominantly about
[GITA:6321] the concept of action (karma yoga), this verse provides a succinct summary
[GITA:6322] of the concepts presented.

[GITA:6359] activities, who is ever contented, and who is focused on the Lord, even

[GITA:6361] any activities. (4.20)
[GITA:6363] One who performs duties without any expectations, who has control
[GITA:6364] over mind and intellect, and who has no attachment to the physical body
[GITA:6365] will not be tainted by sin for actions performed solely for physical
[GITA:6366] sustenance. (4.21)
[GITA:6368] One who is con tent with whatever is given by the Lord, who is
[GITA:6369] beyond dualities (such as pain or pleasure ), who harbors no jealousy and
[GITA:6370] who treats success or failure with equanimity will not be entangled by
[GITA:6371] actions. (4.22)
[GITA:6373] Actions will not taint one who acts without exp ectations, who is
[GITA:6374] unattached to the physical body, who has  the mind focused on the Lord and
[GITA:6375] who performs duties as an offering (yagna) to the Lord. (4.23)
[GITA:6377] Comments: Verse 4.18  identified a wise person as one who performs
[GITA:6378] prescribed duties fully and perfec tly. These five verses describe the major
[GITA:6379] characteristics of such a person.
[GITA:6381] 1. Pandita: Verse 4.19  describes one who has conclusive knowledge as
[GITA:6382] Pandita, as recognized by learned ones. Such a person would have
[GITA:6383] incinerated all activities in the fire of spiritual knowledge.
[GITA:6385] 2. Ever Contented: Verse 4.20  describes a wise person as being ever
[GITA:6386] contented and not having any needs. Such a person has no
[GITA:6387] attachment to either activities or any outcomes from activities and
[GITA:6388] considers the self as a reflection of the indepen dent Lord. Even when
[GITA:6389] performing actions, such a person is considered as  not performing
[GITA:6390] any action at all, meaning such actions will not be binding.
[GITA:6402] Chapter 4                                                                                                                                           129
[GITA:6404] 3. Detached: Verse 4.21  describes a wise person as one who performs
[GITA:6405] prescribed duties with no bodily attachment s. Such a person when
[GITA:6406] performing day to day activities for physical sustenance will not be
[GITA:6407] tainted by any sins arising from such actions.
[GITA:6409] 4. Equanimous: Verse 4.22  describes a wise person as one who is not
[GITA:6410] perturbed by happiness or sadness, gain, or loss etc . Such a person
[GITA:6411] will not harbor jealousy over someone’s success and will be content
[GITA:6412] with whatever is granted by the Lord.
[GITA:6414] 5. Conviction in Divine Knowledge: Verse 4.23  summarizes the
[GITA:6415] characteristics of the wise person described in the previous 4 verses
[GITA:6416] and states that such a person is able to achieve these characteristics
[GITA:6417] due to single minded focus on the Lord. Such a person will indeed
[GITA:6418] perform all prescribed activities without expectations , without bodily
[GITA:6419] attachment, with knowledge about the independent Lor d, and as an
[GITA:6420] offering (yagna) to please the Lord. Such activities will not entangle
[GITA:6421] a wise person and will pave the way for liberation by the grace of the
[GITA:6422] Lord.
[GITA:6424] Verse 4.22 seems to identify two characteristics of a wise person – one
[GITA:6425] who is beyond dualities and one who is equipoised in success or failure. Do
[GITA:6426] these both mean the same and hence there is a repetition here? No. Sri Jaya
[GITA:6427] Teertha in [PD] clarifies that these two characteristics have a causal
[GITA:6428] relationship. One who is tolerant of dualities is equip oised in success or
[GITA:6429] failure.

[GITA:6452] ritual activities are all under the control of the Lord as He pervades and
[GITA:6453] owns everything. One who understands this truth will indeed reach the
[GITA:6454] Lord’s abode. (4.24)
[GITA:6455] Comments: In the previous verse, a wise person is described as
[GITA:6456] someone who has conviction in divine knowledge. This verse explains  and
[GITA:6457] describes such conviction. All aspects involved in the performance of
[GITA:6458] yagna (sacrifice) are under the control of the Lord. This  is also consistent
[GITA:6459] with verse 4.21, where a wise person was described as one who is detached.
[GITA:6460] Sri Rayaru in GV  explains the proper way of interpreting compound words
[GITA:6461] such as brahma havi  following the interp retation in Sri Madhwacharya’s
[GITA:6462] GTN. There are multiple ways of de riving such compound words in
[GITA:6463] Sanskrit. There is a danger that one can interpret brahma havi to mean that
[GITA:6464] the sacrifices offered in a sacrifice is identical with the Lord. Sri
[GITA:6465] Madhwacharya [GTN] interprets brahma havi as brahmani + havi ,
[GITA:6466] meaning the sacrifices offered in a sacrifice belongs to the Lord. This
[GITA:6467] applies to other aspects appearing  in this verse. This interpretation is also
[GITA:6468] consistent with the characteristics of a w ise person described in verses
[GITA:6469] 4.19 – 4.23.
[GITA:6470] Notes: The Sanskrit word yagna does not have a direct equivalent in
[GITA:6471] English. In general, yagna means an intense act or endeavor that is
[GITA:6472] performed for a specific purpose such as propitiating the Lord Almighty or
[GITA:6473] some other deities. Many scholars loosely translate yagna as sacrifice,
[GITA:6474] perhaps referring to offerings that are sacrifice d during fire rituals. In
[GITA:6475] keeping with the traditional translation, yagna will be translated as sacrifice
[GITA:6476] in this book with the knowledge that yagna actually stands for an intense
[GITA:6477] endeavor performed for a specific purpose.

[GITA:6499] Comments: The next six verses 4 -25 to 4 -30 describe the different
[GITA:6500] types of yagna (sacrifice) performed by different seekers to stress the point
[GITA:6501] that yagna does not mean only performing ritual sac rifices with fire but it
[GITA:6502] also has a metaphorical meaning.
[GITA:6504] In a later verse , (4.31) it is indicated that one who does not perform
[GITA:6505] sacrificial rituals will not achieve anything  of value either in this world or
[GITA:6506] in other worlds. This verse clarifies that for some seekers such as ascetics,
[GITA:6507] worshipping the Lord is itself a Vedic sacrificial ritual. In verse 4.23, it was
[GITA:6508] indicated that wise people perform activities for the sake of yagna
[GITA:6509] (yagnaya acharate). This verse, by specifically stating that ascetics worshi p
[GITA:6510] yagna (the Lord), confirms that the word yagna also refers to the Lord
[GITA:6511] Almighty.

[GITA:6543] seekers.
[GITA:6545] Some seekers exercise control of sense organs of perception - eyes,

[GITA:6547] objects and divert these sense organs towards the Lord. For example,
[GITA:6548] restraining ears from listening to meaningless worldly stories and focusing
[GITA:6549] them on the stories of the Lord Almighty. Even when consuming objects of
[GITA:6550] senses such as food, seekers p artake in them with the knowledge that they

[GITA:6604] Comments: In verses 4.26 and 4.27 , it was stated that some see kers
[GITA:6605] perform the sacrifice of controlling their sense organs. In this verse, there is
[GITA:6606] a specific example of seekers controlling the consumption of food to drive
[GITA:6607] home the fact that of all indulgences, food is the most difficult to cont rol.
[GITA:6608] As was indicated in verse 2.59 , when one practices fasting, the sense
[GITA:6609] organs get weakened, but the craving for tasty food does not go away.
[GITA:6610] When one ages, the sense organs start losing their effectiveness one by one,
[GITA:6611] but the tongue and its craving for food never goes away . Some seekers
[GITA:6612] perform the difficult task of controlling their food intake (just enough for
[GITA:6613] physical existence) by will power and offer this sacrifice to the Lord.
[GITA:6615] Sri Rayaru in GV  gives an additional interpretation for this verse.
[GITA:6616] Sense organs are controlled by deities such as Indra, Surya etc. Deities such
[GITA:6617] as Garuda, Rudra, and Sesha who control the functioning of the mind are
[GITA:6618] superior to the deities controlling the sense organs. Some seekers
[GITA:6619] understand this hierarchy, control their indulgence in food t hrough will
[GITA:6620] power and offer that as a sacrifice to the Lord.

[GITA:6640] these sacrifices will not achieve anything of value in this world, leave alone

[GITA:6643] Comments: After describing the types of sacrifices performed by
[GITA:6644] seekers in verses 4 -25 to 4 -30, this verse describes the difference in
[GITA:6645] rewards attained by those who perform these types of sacrifices and those
[GITA:6646] who do not. One who performs such selfless sacrifices will indeed reach
[GITA:6647] the Lord and others wh o do not perform these would have wasted their
[GITA:6648] lives. It is interesting to note that this verse specifically states that those
[GITA:6649] who do not perform such sacrifices will not receive any rewards in this
[GITA:6650] world. How can one prove that? One of the sacrifices identified was control
[GITA:6651] of food consumption. It is seen by experience that those who indulge in
[GITA:6652] excessive food consumption on a continuous basis end up with lifestyle
[GITA:6653] diseases such as obesity, blood pressure etc. Hence, these austerities are
[GITA:6654] also required to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

[GITA:6661] and physical actions, conduct your prescribed duties with proper
[GITA:6662] knowledge and achieve release from bondage. (4.32)
[GITA:6664] Comments: This verse clarifies that  different types of sacrifices are
[GITA:6665] directed towards the Lord. This point is expanded later in verse 9.24, where
[GITA:6666] the Lord declares that He is the owner and indeed the destination for all
[GITA:6678] Chapter 4                                                                                                                                           135
[GITA:6680] sacrifices. After describing the various types of sacrifices performed by
[GITA:6681] seekers, the Lord asks Arjuna to understand that these sacrifices are to be
[GITA:6682] performed mentally, vocally, and physically, and that he should engage in
[GITA:6683] his prescribed duty of participating in the war to protect his citizens. This
[GITA:6684] advice is especially important as one can question the need to indulge in a
[GITA:6685] destructive war when one can achieve liberati on by following other
[GITA:6686] sacrifices such as th e acquisition and dissemination of knowledge. This
[GITA:6687] verse clarifies that one must perform one ’s prescribed duty as a worship to
[GITA:6688] the Lord, which is also a form of sacrifice.

[GITA:6699] for fruitful completion. (4.33)
[GITA:6701] Comments: Verses 4.25 to 4.30  described different types of
[GITA:6702] sacrifices performed by seekers in their quest for sel f-realization and
[GITA:6703] liberation. Among the different types of sacrifices described, which is
[GITA:6704] superior? This verse answers by stating that sacrifice in the form of
[GITA:6705] acquisition and dissemination of divine, spiritual knowledge is most
[GITA:6706] superior. The reason for it s supremacy is its ability to bring to fruition the
[GITA:6707] prescribed duties performed by a seeker. After all, one cannot perform any
[GITA:6708] activity, if one does not have the knowledge of the need for such an action,
[GITA:6709] or the method of performance of such action etc. One  cannot conclude that
[GITA:6710] only acquiring such knowledge is good enough. Such  knowledge must be
[GITA:6711] accompanied by proper performance of prescribed duties for one to succeed
[GITA:6712] in one’s spiritual journey.

[GITA:6736] spiritual knowledge and approach that teacher with respect, humility, and
[GITA:6737] an inquisitive mind to learn. In verse 2.7 , Arjuna had surrendered to Lord
[GITA:6738] Krishna as his teacher to help clear his doubts. One must follow this
[GITA:6739] example to acquire true knowledge.

[GITA:6748] Comments: Arjuna was stricken with grief at the thought of losing
[GITA:6749] his loved ones in the war. As discussed in Chapter  1, this resulted in
[GITA:6750] clouding of his judgement and led to his questions and doubts about duty,
[GITA:6751] knowledge etc. Lord Krishna states in this verse that Arjuna w ould
[GITA:6752] overcome his ignorance by understanding Krishna ’s teaching which would
[GITA:6753] convince him that everyone is controlled, protected, and pervaded by  the
[GITA:6754] Lord. By using the phrases mayi (within Me) and sarva bhootani  (all
[GITA:6755] beings - plural), the Lord is making it truly clear that He is supreme, and all
[GITA:6756] beings act  under His control. This is one of the core concepts of the
[GITA:6757] philosophy of dualism of Sri Madhwacharya.

[GITA:6798] Just as one needs a boat to cross a river, similarly one needs proper
[GITA:6799] knowledge to traverse the river of worldly afflictions. A boat does not row
[GITA:6800] itself. It needs a sailor. Similarly, mere knowledge is not goo d enough. One
[GITA:6801] needs a proper teacher, and one must practice and act  upon such
[GITA:6802] knowledge. In verse 4.37 , it is stated that the fire of knowledge burns off
[GITA:6803] ill-effects of action just as a blazing fire turns wood into ashes. This implies
[GITA:6804] that knowledge should be sharp, strong, and powerful, just like a blazing
[GITA:6805] fire. Verse 4.38  categorically states that such knowledge is superior to
[GITA:6817] 138                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita

[GITA:6887] concludes the discussion in this chapter by encouraging Arjuna to get rid of
[GITA:6888] the doubts in his mind through proper knowledge and focus on his
[GITA:6889] prescribed duty of waging the rightful war with proper conviction.
[GITA:6891] Summary of Chapter 4
[GITA:6893] In chapter 3, the Lord taught that one must perform one ’s prescribed
[GITA:6894] duties without expectations. In this chapter, the Lord teaches more about
[GITA:6895] the nature of activities ( karma) of both the Lord and individual beings. In
[GITA:6896] verses 4.1-3, the Lord says that He had taught th is spiritual knowledge
[GITA:6897] previously to deities such as Surya etc. In response to Arjuna’s question in
[GITA:6909] 140                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:6910] 4.4 about the chronology of the Lord’s current manifestation and those of
[GITA:6911] other deities, the Lord provides details of His incarnations in 4.5-9 stating
[GITA:6912] that He manifests at  His own free will from time to time to protect
[GITA:6913] righteousness and virtu e in society and to destroy evil. In verse 4.13 , the
[GITA:6914] Lord discusses the creatio n of living beings based on one ’s innate nature,
[GITA:6915] aptitude, and activities. In ver se 4.14 , the Lord states that He h as no
[GITA:6916] obligations and activities do not bind Him. He states that one who clearly
[GITA:6917] understands the distinction between the supreme soul and individual souls
[GITA:6918] will not be entangled by actions. Categories and nature of activ ities are
[GITA:6919] described in verses 4.16-33 which provide comparison of nishkama karma
[GITA:6920] to other types of activities ( karma), and details of the types of nishkama
[GITA:6921] karma. Verses 4.16 to 4.18 , compare the different types of activities –
[GITA:6922] karma (right action), vikarma (prohibited action), and akarma (inaction).
[GITA:6923] Verse 4.18 describes the two attributes of one who is performing one’s duty
[GITA:6924] perfectly– (i) such a person realizes that even when performing prescribed
[GITA:6925] duties, the actual work is being enabled by the Lord  himself  and (ii)  when
[GITA:6926] not actively performing duties , (ex: during  sleep, dream)  activity such as
[GITA:6927] breathing is enabled by the Lord. Such a wise person will derive full
[GITA:6928] benefits from duties performed. In that sense verse 4.18  is a summary of
[GITA:6929] this entire chapter. Five verses (4.1 9- 23) describe the  characteristics of
[GITA:6930] such a wise person, which briefly are – pandit (highly knowledgeable), ever
[GITA:6931] contented, detached, equanimous. That person would also have deep
[GITA:6932] conviction in divine, spiritual knowledg e. Verses 4.24-30 contain a
[GITA:6933] discussion on different ty pes of sacrifices performed by seekers in their
[GITA:6934] quest for self -realization and liberation. These verses emphatically state
[GITA:6935] that Vedic sacrifice (yagna) not only refer s to the symbolic act s of
[GITA:6936] propitiating deities with fire rituals etc., but also refer s to other selfless acts
[GITA:6937] such as donating to charity, devotional worship to  the Lord Almighty,
[GITA:6938] spiritual education, self -control, self -discipline etc. The discussion on
[GITA:6939] sacrifices is concluded in verse 4.32 where the Lord exhorts Arjuna to fight
[GITA:6940] the just war to protect his citizens as that is his prescribed duty. Performing
[GITA:6952] Chapter 4                                                                                                                                           141
[GITA:6954] one’s prescribed duty as an offering to the Lord is indeed a superior form of
[GITA:6955] worshipping the Lord. In verse 4.33 , the Lord teaches that action is
[GITA:6956] complete only when it is accompanied by knowledge. In verses 4.36-38, the
[GITA:6957] Lord describes the great ness of knowledge and in verse 4.39  outlines the
[GITA:6958] attributes of a seeker searching for right knowledge. This chapter is
[GITA:6959] concluded in verse  4.42, where Lord Krishna exhorts Arjuna to use
[GITA:6960] knowledge (jnana) to get over any doubts he had about waging the war and
[GITA:6961] to focus on fighting the just war with conviction.

[GITA:6978] Chapter 5 - The Path of Renunciation
[GITA:6980] Chapter Introduction:  This chapter of 29 ver ses is known as
[GITA:6981] Sanyasa Yoga  (The Path of Renunciation). Renunciation of worldly
[GITA:6982] pleasures is termed sanyasa and performing prescribed duties as an offering
[GITA:6983] to the Lord is termed yoga (action). In this chapter, the Lord answers
[GITA:6984] Arjuna’s questions on fundamental aspects of these two concepts – sanyasa
[GITA:6985] and yoga. Arjuna’s argument is  that if renunciation were a better option
[GITA:6986] than action, he c ould perhaps adopt the life of an ascetic and avoid waging
[GITA:6987] the war. The Lord goes on to describe the characteristics of a renunciant
[GITA:6988] and clarifies that one must incorporate both these paths to achieve self -
[GITA:6989] realization. The Lord reiterates that Arjuna must focus on performing his
[GITA:6990] prescribed duty of waging the war to protect his citizens from the evil
[GITA:6991] Kauravas. This chapter a lso delves into the importance of detachment and
[GITA:6992] the characteristics of seekers who have developed detachment from
[GITA:6993] rewards through self-control.
[GITA:6995] Action or Renunciation? Which is Better?

[GITA:7001] Arjuna said: O Krishna! Sometimes you seem to praise the path of
[GITA:7002] renunciation and other times you seem to praise the path of action. Please
[GITA:7003] tell me clearly, which of the two is beneficial. (5.1)
[GITA:7005] Comments: In verse 2.4 8, the Lord clearly directs Arjuna to focus
[GITA:7006] on his prescribed duties without expectations. This concept was expanded
[GITA:7007] in Chapter 3 (karma yoga). In verse 4.22, from Chapter 4 ( jnana yoga), the
[GITA:7008] Lord stated that one must be equanimous in the face of happiness /sadness
[GITA:7009] and be content with whatever is granted by Him. These two characteristics
[GITA:7021] Chapter 5                                                                                                                                                143
[GITA:7023] are described by ‘yoga’ and ‘sanyasa’. If the latter is the better path, then
[GITA:7024] Arjuna could conclude that he would be better off focusing on
[GITA:7025] relinquishing all activities  and developing equanimity and devotion to the
[GITA:7026] Lord. He could then perhaps avoid participating in the destructive war.
[GITA:7028] Sri Rayaru in GV  gives us a second interpretation, where the
[GITA:7029] question is related to the comparison between ascetics and householders.
[GITA:7030] Verse 4.41 can be interpreted as describing the attribute of a  seeker who
[GITA:7031] has relinquished all outcomes from actions and has taken on  the role of an
[GITA:7032] ascetic. Verse 4.42  directs that one must perform one ’s prescribed duties
[GITA:7033] and hence can be interpreted as referring to a householder. So, Arjuna
[GITA:7034] could also be enquiring about the comparison between an ascetic and a
[GITA:7035] householder, and if the former were the better of the two, he c ould perhaps
[GITA:7036] embrace ascetism and avoid the battle.

[GITA:7044] The Lord said:  Renunciation of worldly pleasures ( sanyasa) and
[GITA:7045] performing prescribed duties (yoga) are both necessary for one to ach ieve
[GITA:7046] liberation. Performing prescribed action is better than merely renouncing
[GITA:7047] worldly pleasures. (5.2)
[GITA:7049] Comments: The Lord categorically states that both –renunciation of
[GITA:7050] worldly pleasures  (sanyasa) and  performing prescribed duties as an
[GITA:7051] offering to  Him (karma yoga ) are necessary for one to achieve
[GITA:7052] self-realization and liberation. One cannot conclude that only ascetics
[GITA:7053] practice detachment and they do not have any obligations on action. Nor do
[GITA:7054] householders only practice prescribed activities without practicing
[GITA:7055] self-control. So, one cannot argue that  sanyasa and karma yoga  cannot
[GITA:7056] co-exist in the same person. Lord Krishna recognizes Arjuna’s motivation
[GITA:7068] 144                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:7069] in this question and states that performing prescribed duties as an offering
[GITA:7070] to the Lord ( karma yoga) is su perior to mere detachment, equanimity etc.
[GITA:7071] (sanyasa), but both are required for achieving self -realization and ultimate
[GITA:7072] liberation. Again, the Lord is impressing upon Arjuna that he must not
[GITA:7073] avoid participating in his prescribed duty of fighting the just war.

[GITA:7081] bondage. (5.3)
[GITA:7083] Comments: This verse clarifies that renunciation is not an attribute
[GITA:7084] of only ascetics. Sri Rayaru [GV] states that i n verse 4.22 , the Lord
[GITA:7085] described the attributes of one who has renounced, but  without using the
[GITA:7086] term sanyasa. Here He clarifies that such a person is a sanyasi (renunciant).
[GITA:7087] This is important because Arjuna , in his question in 5.1  had used the term
[GITA:7088] sanyasa.

[GITA:7093] Ignorant people say that the path of knowledge and the path of action
[GITA:7094] (performed as an offering to the Lord without expectation of outcome) are
[GITA:7095] different and  are not causally related.  Learned ones do not say that.
[GITA:7096] Whichever path is proper ly followed, it will lead to the results obtainable
[GITA:7097] from both the paths. (5.4)
[GITA:7099] Comments: The Lord clarifies that the paths of knowledge and
[GITA:7100] action are not exclusive but  are in fact  causally related  (i.e. complement
[GITA:7101] each other). Some scriptures such as the Bhagavata Maha Purana [BMP],
[GITA:7102] in canto 11, chapter 21, state that those who focus only on ritualistic fire
[GITA:7114] Chapter 5                                                                                                                                                145
[GITA:7116] sacrifices will only end up with irritation in the eyes due to smoke (in other
[GITA:7117] words they do not achieve anything of value). Sri Rayaru in [GV] c larifies
[GITA:7118] that the reference in BMP  is related to someone who performs ritualistic
[GITA:7119] activities with expectations on rewards and without offering the  fruits to the
[GITA:7120] Lord. Such activities are pointless. In summary, both the paths of
[GITA:7121] renunciation and action are comp lementing each other and result in a
[GITA:7122] seeker achieving divine, spiritual knowledge.

[GITA:7130] abode. The one who understands this is a true knower. (5.5)
[GITA:7132] Comments: The previous verse stated that both the paths of
[GITA:7133] knowledge and action are important. How can one deduce that actions lead
[GITA:7134] to knowledge? The Lord answers by stating that even those in the path of
[GITA:7135] action do reach the His abode but through the path of divine, spiritual
[GITA:7136] knowledge. These two paths are symbiotically r elated. Sri Rayaru in GV
[GITA:7137] states a second interpretation of this verse as follows – The goal that is
[GITA:7138] attained by a seeker who is an ascetic is also reachable by seekers who are
[GITA:7139] householders (non-ascetics). Ascetics who have renounced everything will
[GITA:7140] also perform activities, and householders act based on knowledge acquired.

[GITA:7161] performs prescribed action as an offering to the Lord  while renouncing
[GITA:7162] worldly pleasures will indeed reach the Lord. (5.6)
[GITA:7164] Comments: In this verse the Lord clarifies that mere renunciation of
[GITA:7165] worldly pleasures while abdicating prescribed duties leads one to downfall.
[GITA:7166] Developing detachment from rewards requires  a lot of mental effort. Such
[GITA:7167] efforts should not be wasted for temporary rewards. In addition to
[GITA:7168] renouncing worldly pleas ures, one must focus on performing one’s
[GITA:7169] prescribed duties as an offering to the Lord as this leads to liberation and
[GITA:7170] lasting peace. On the other hand, a seeker who performs prescribed actions
[GITA:7171] without attachment to the rewards, but as an offering to the Lo rd will
[GITA:7172] indeed reach the Lord’s abode. The goal of every action should be to please
[GITA:7173] the Lord.

[GITA:7234] Comments: In verse  5.6, it was stated that a seeker needs both

[GITA:7237] the concepts in these verses and categorically states that such a seeker will

[GITA:7239] This verse identifies the attributes of such a seeker who has incorporated
[GITA:7240] both renunciation and action. Such a seeker –

[GITA:7253]  will not claim ownership on activities.
[GITA:7254]  has full conviction that the Lord causes all activities.
[GITA:7255]  performs activities as a worship to the Lord.
[GITA:7256]  is detached from any rewards from such actions.
[GITA:7257]  offers any accrued rewards to the Lord.
[GITA:7258]  is aware that the Lord has caused these activities for the benefit of
[GITA:7259] the seeker.
[GITA:7261] Such a seeker is not impacted by any effects of such action, just as
[GITA:7262] water does not cling to a lotus leaf. The comparison with the lotus is very
[GITA:7263] apt. The lotus is hydrophobic as even when it is immersed in water, it does
[GITA:7264] not hold water. Sim ilarly, the seeker described here, even when immersed
[GITA:7265] in worldly activities will not be tainted by any effects of such actions.

[GITA:7283] for any activity. Such a seeker can cleanse  his mind. A pure mind can

[GITA:7324] Comments: In verses 5 -8 to 5 -9, it was stated that a true seeker is
[GITA:7325] aware that none of the actions performed by that seeker are independently
[GITA:7326] performed. They are in fact performed by the Lord , using the seeker as an
[GITA:7327] instrument. This verse clarifies that such a seeker also needs to be aware
[GITA:7328] that the seeker also cannot cause those actions to be performed
[GITA:7329] independently. The Lord is responsible for all activities which are
[GITA:7330] performed by Him of His own free will. Such a seeker even w hen residing
[GITA:7331] in a physical body having nine orifices (like nine doors to a city) will
[GITA:7332] experience peace and will not be tainted by any activities.

[GITA:7366] Living beings cannot independently diminish sins nor claim credit
[GITA:7367] for good deeds. Their knowledge is veiled by ignorance, and hence they are
[GITA:7368] deluded. Being deluded, they cannot realize the Lord. (5.15)
[GITA:7370] Comments: Verses 5.8&5.9 state that living beings, wh en they interact
[GITA:7371] with the external world ( through actions such as seeing, talking) are not
[GITA:7372] actually doing so on their own. These two verses provide more insight into
[GITA:7373] the nature of action s as they relate t o living beings. Sri Rayaru in GV
[GITA:7374] provides two inter pretations for these verses depending on the attribution
[GITA:7375] for the words ‘prabhu’ in 5.14 and ‘vibhu’ in 5.15, both of which mean the
[GITA:7376] Lord. These two words can be either attributed to jiva, the individual soul
[GITA:7377] (as it is superior to inert objects) as also to the Lord Almighty (who is the
[GITA:7378] Lord of all).
[GITA:7390] Chapter 5                                                                                                                                                151
[GITA:7393]  Individual Souls: The first half of the verse 5.14 states that individual
[GITA:7394] souls cannot act on their own or can they cause action by someone
[GITA:7395] else. How about the reward for actions performed, regardless of how
[GITA:7396] they are performed? The second half of the verse (5.14) answers by
[GITA:7397] stating that individuals also do not have independence on the issue  of
[GITA:7398] rewards. The first half of 5.15  states that individual souls do not
[GITA:7399] accrue negative or positive effects of action on thei r own. If the Lord
[GITA:7400] is responsible for all actions, why is it that no one can physically see
[GITA:7401] the Lord? The second ha lf of 5.15  states that individuals cannot see
[GITA:7402] the Lord as they are covered by ignorance.
[GITA:7404]  Lord Almighty: The Lord has not granted individuals , ability to act
[GITA:7405] on their own. Likewise, the Lord has also not granted individuals, the
[GITA:7406] liberty to claim reward s for their actions on their own. If the Lord is
[GITA:7407] responsible for all actions of the individuals, will the Lord not be
[GITA:7408] tainted by such actions? The first half of 5.15  states that the Lord is
[GITA:7409] not tainted by actions of the individuals. The Lord provides
[GITA:7410] individuals apparatus and facilities to act based on the individuals’
[GITA:7411] innate nature to help them in their spiritual journey.
[GITA:7412] There are several questio ns that arise at this stage regarding the nature
[GITA:7413] of actions related to an individual soul, inert objects, and the Lord. These
[GITA:7414] questions are summarized as follows:
[GITA:7415]  If an individual soul does not have independence in performing
[GITA:7416] actions, how can that soul be held responsible for the consequences
[GITA:7417] of such actions?
[GITA:7419]  If the Lord Almighty is the one who is independent and is
[GITA:7420] responsible for all actions performed by individual souls, how can
[GITA:7421] the Lord be immune from the effects of such actions?
[GITA:7422] Sri Madhwacharya in hi s commentary on the Brahma Sutras  [BSB]
[GITA:7423] and in other works such as GTN , adequately answers these questions.
[GITA:7435] 152                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:7436] Firstly, one must understand the nature of attributes, doership (doer is an
[GITA:7437] entity that performs some action) and independence as they relate to the
[GITA:7438] three entities in the universe namely, individual souls, inert objects, and the
[GITA:7439] Lord Almighty.
[GITA:7441] Attribute\Entity Inert Objects Individual Souls Lord Almighty
[GITA:7442] Doership No Yes Yes
[GITA:7443] Independence No No Yes
[GITA:7445] The Lord  is independent in all aspects and has un limited ability to
[GITA:7446] perform activities independently. Hence, He has both doership and
[GITA:7447] independence. Inert objects neither have ability to perform anything nor do
[GITA:7448] they have independence. Individual souls do have doership but not
[GITA:7449] independence, hence they have  dependent doership. The relationship
[GITA:7450] between the Lord, inert objects and living beings is illustrated with the
[GITA:7451] example of a dairy farmer milking a cow through it s udders in Sri
[GITA:7452] Madhwacharya’s GTN 3-33. All three entities are required in the task of
[GITA:7453] extracting milk from a cow. The udder is akin to an inert object. It cannot
[GITA:7454] act, nor does it have any awareness or intent. The cow is  a living being. It
[GITA:7455] has awareness, it produces milk, it has an intention to give milk, but it
[GITA:7456] cannot independently extract milk f rom itself. The dairy farmer is like the
[GITA:7457] Lord who uses the udder and extracts milk from the cow.
[GITA:7458] Armed with the above information, the two questions raised can be
[GITA:7459] answered as follows:
[GITA:7461]  Individual souls also have the quality of doership, but they are  not
[GITA:7462] independent. The Lord grants individuals the ability to perform
[GITA:7463] activities based on their innate intent ( iccha), attempt (prayatna) and
[GITA:7464] knowledge ( jnana). After all everyone has an intent to achieve
[GITA:7465] liberation. The Lord recognizes this intent and grants the souls
[GITA:7466] facilities such as a physical body, mind, intellect and sense organs to
[GITA:7467] attain knowledge and perform prescribed duties. Even though
[GITA:7468] individual souls do not have independence in action, they do have
[GITA:7469] responsibility for their actions and hence are subje ct to dos and
[GITA:7481] Chapter 5                                                                                                                                                153
[GITA:7483] don’ts (vidhi, nishedha). The key here is the intent that is present in
[GITA:7484] individual souls. This concept is clarified in Brahma Sutra (2.3.47).
[GITA:7486]  The Lord is not tainted by actions performed by individual souls as
[GITA:7487] the Lord merely grants them the  ability to perform such actions. The
[GITA:7488] Lord has nothing to gain by providing  individual souls with the
[GITA:7489] facilities they need. He does so out of pure compassion.
[GITA:7491] With the above information one can also resolve apparent conflicts in
[GITA:7492] spiritual texts where in s ome texts individual souls are described as not
[GITA:7493] having the attribute of doership, while in other texts the individual souls are
[GITA:7494] described as having the attribute of doership. The former is indicating that
[GITA:7495] the doership is not independent and the latter is i ndicating that the doership
[GITA:7496] is dependent.

[GITA:7505] Comments: The previous verse 5.15  indicated that the limitations of
[GITA:7506] individual beings are due to their knowledge enveloped by ignorance. This
[GITA:7507] verse clarifies how such ig norance can be overcome. If one ’s innate
[GITA:7508] knowledge is cov ered by ignorance , how can that person be convinced to
[GITA:7509] perform prescribed duties (yoga) with detachment (sanyasa)? Sri Rayaru in
[GITA:7510] GV explains that knowledge that is enveloped by ignorance is the innate
[GITA:7511] knowledge (swaroopa jnana ) that is specific to a soul. The ignorance can
[GITA:7512] be removed by the seeker obtaining proper knowledge through scriptural
[GITA:7513] studies and teachings from a Guru. This knowledge is termed ‘ paroksha’
[GITA:7514] (indirect). Thus, a seeker by obtaining paroksha knowledge can get rid of
[GITA:7515] ignorance, perform pre scribed duties with detachment and attain divine,
[GITA:7516] spiritual (aparoksha or direct) knowledge and reach the Lord.

[GITA:7538] Comments: Verse 5.16 states  that a seeker m ust acquire indirect

[GITA:7540] acquiring divine, spiritual knowledge that eventually leads  to moksha. This
[GITA:7541] verse clarifies that one cannot expect to acquire direct knowledge
[GITA:7542] (aparoksha) immedi ately after acquiring indirect knowledge. One must
[GITA:7543] repeatedly study scriptures with the mind fully immersed in the Lord and
[GITA:7544] ensure that the knowledge acquired is without any doubts and develop full
[GITA:7545] conviction in such knowledge. This will allow a seeker to be prepared to

[GITA:7630] Comments: Verse 5.6  states that mere renunciation of worldly
[GITA:7631] pleasures while abdicating actions is pointless. However, one can argue that
[GITA:7632] by pract ising detachment from sense pleasures , one can overcome desires
[GITA:7633] and experience peace. In this case, why perform any specific activities?
[GITA:7634] This verse states that any peace that is attained by withdrawal from
[GITA:7635] attachment to sense pleasures is temporary. To exp erience unlimited bliss,
[GITA:7636] one must also focus on performing activities such as meditation with the
[GITA:7637] mind steadfastly focused on the Lord. This verse uses the term akshaya
[GITA:7638] meaning ‘unlimited’ in the second line . The procedure for meditation is
[GITA:7639] described later  in the verses 5.27 and 5.28 . Sri Rayaru has a second
[GITA:7640] interpretation for this verse as follows:  A renunciant will experience some
[GITA:7641] amount of bliss just by remembering the Lord. It goes without saying that
[GITA:7642] when renunciation is coupled with deep medi tation on the Lord, the seeker
[GITA:7643] will be on the path to achieve moksha (unending bliss).

[GITA:7667] Comments: Why do learned  ones avoid indulging in pleasurable

[GITA:7670] term, always end up in misery (for example, the long term health effects of

[GITA:7685] living forms, such as animals , to develop such detachment. Hence, one
[GITA:7686] should not waste the opportunity that the Lord has provided by granting
[GITA:7687] one a human form. Sri Padm anabha Teertha , in his commentary Gita
[GITA:7688] Bhashya Bhava Pradeepika  [GBBP] clarifies that the use of the word
[GITA:7689] nara (human) in this verse does not imply that only humans are eligible for
[GITA:7690] bliss. Those who have attained Brahma Loka  (the abode of Brahma) are
[GITA:7691] also eligible for bliss as they do not have emotions of desire, anger , etc. Sri

[GITA:7715] They experience bliss on two counts. Firstly, by overcoming passions such
[GITA:7716] as desire and aversion, they feel liberated. Second, by focusing on the Lord
[GITA:7717] in their mind s, they exp erience inner bliss. They are focused only on the
[GITA:7718] Lord and nothing else, as indicated by the use of the word eva (only) in the

[GITA:7809] Summary of Chapter 5
[GITA:7811] In chapter 3, the Lord t aught that one must perform one s prescribed
[GITA:7812] duties without expectations . (nishkama karma ). In chapter 4, the Lord
[GITA:7813] imparts knowledge ( jnana) about the nature of activities ( karma) of both
[GITA:7814] the Lord and ind ividual beings. In chapter 5, the Lord answers some
[GITA:7815] fundamental questions from Arjuna (5.1) regarding the concepts of
[GITA:7816] renunciation ( sanyasa) and action ( karma). It is apparent from Arjuna’s
[GITA:7817] question that if renunciation were a better option than action, he  could
[GITA:7818] perhaps adopt the life of an ascetic and avoid waging the war. The Lord
[GITA:7819] answers (5.2) by stating that while both the paths of renunciation and action
[GITA:7820] lead one to liberation, the path of action is superior. The Lord goes on to
[GITA:7821] describe the character istics of a renunciant (5.2) and clarifies that one must
[GITA:7822] incorporate both these paths to achieve self -realization (5.6). An of t quoted
[GITA:7823] example is that of a person who is sick in the stomach due to an unhealthy
[GITA:7824] diet. For such a person to heal , it is importa nt to both consume the
[GITA:7825] medication prescribed by the doctor and at the same time avoid indulging
[GITA:7826] in an unhealthy diet. By stating that the path of action is superior, the Lord
[GITA:7827] is clarifying to Arjuna that he must participate in his prescribed duty of
[GITA:7828] waging this war to protect his citizens , while detaching himself from any
[GITA:7829] outcomes of his actions. The Lord also clarifies that both ascetics and
[GITA:7830] householders are equally eligible to attain salvation , based on their efforts.
[GITA:7831] An ascetic who may have acquired divi ne, spiritual knowledge will still be
[GITA:7832] involved in performing activities and likewise a householder who is
[GITA:7833] preoccupied with performing prescribed activities will also be involved in
[GITA:7834] acquiring spiritual knowledge. Some scriptures downplay the role of
[GITA:7846] Chapter 5                                                                                                                                                161
[GITA:7848] actions such as ritual fire sacrifices which may only result in eye irritation ,
[GITA:7849] due to smoke. It is clarified that any such description of action is related to
[GITA:7850] actions that are performed with specific expectations. They do not apply to
[GITA:7851] actions performed as an off ering to the Lord without expectations (5.4). It
[GITA:7852] is also clarified that one cannot achieve much by merely relinquishing the
[GITA:7853] outcomes of actions, without offering them to the Lord. Any activity can be
[GITA:7854] deemed as complete and useful only when such activities are performed
[GITA:7855] with a pure mind and as an offering to the Lord with no material
[GITA:7856] expectations (5.6). An ideal seeker is one who performs prescribed duties
[GITA:7857] with detachment towards the rewards, performs activities while exercising
[GITA:7858] control over sense organs and the mind, knows that the Lord is the one who
[GITA:7859] is causing the action, and is aware that the Lord Almighty is the L ord of
[GITA:7860] everyone in the universe. He  performs activities with devotion and as a
[GITA:7861] worship to the Lord. Such a seeker will not be tainted by any ef fects of
[GITA:7862] actions just as water does not stick to a lotus leaf (5.10). One should realize
[GITA:7863] that it is the Lord who makes it possible for one to perform any activity.
[GITA:7864] The Lord activates all activities in the universe. However, the individual
[GITA:7865] souls are responsible for the outcomes of their activities, even though they
[GITA:7866] are enabled to act by the Lord. The individual soul has dependent doership
[GITA:7867] and the Lord is the only independent doer. The Lord activates the intent and
[GITA:7868] attempt of the individual souls , hence the i ndividual souls are held
[GITA:7869] responsible for the actions. The Lord is never tainted by any such actions ,
[GITA:7870] as He has nothing to gain by any action and performs them out of pure
[GITA:7871] compassion for the individual souls (5 -14, 5-15). The nature of knowledge
[GITA:7872] in learned ones is described in verses 5.15 to 5.17 . Knowledge is of two
[GITA:7873] types, indirect and direct. The inherent knowledge in individual souls is
[GITA:7874] masked by ignorance, and seekers get rid of this ignorance through spiritual
[GITA:7875] studies, analysis, and listening to lecture s from teachers (indirect
[GITA:7876] knowledge) etc. This paves the way for seekers to achieve self -realization
[GITA:7877] (direct knowledge). Learned ones perceive the same blemishless Lord full
[GITA:7878] of infinite auspicious attributes present in all living beings (5.18). Learned
[GITA:7879] ones who have developed detachment from sense pleasure , experience
[GITA:7880] peace due to a sense of liberation, but everlasting bliss is only possible
[GITA:7881] through meditation with the mind focused exclusively on the Lord (5.12).
[GITA:7893] 162                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:7894] Learned ones avoid indulging in sense pleasures which are temporary and
[GITA:7895] lead only to misery  (5.22). The Lord exhorts one to develop control over
[GITA:7896] sense organs and emotions such as desire, anger in one ’s current lifetime
[GITA:7897] itself while one has a human form, as this will not be possible with other
[GITA:7898] life f orms (5.23). The procedure for performing concentrated meditation
[GITA:7899] which was stated as a necessity in verse 5.21 is described in verses 5.27 and
[GITA:7900] 5.28. The chapter is concluded in 5.29  which describes the characteristics
[GITA:7901] of the Lord who is the goal of such m editation. A seeker who meditates on
[GITA:7902] the Lord, knowing the Lord as the consumer of all sacrifices and rituals, as
[GITA:7903] the Lord of all, and as one who is the well-wisher for everyone, will indeed
[GITA:7904] achieve liberation.

[GITA:7923] Chapter 6 - The Path of Self Restraint
[GITA:7925] Chapter Introduction: This chapter of 47 verses is termed Atma
[GITA:7926] Samyama Yoga (The Path of Self Restraint) or Dhyana Yoga (The Path of
[GITA:7927] Meditation). The previous chapters described the broad contours of the path
[GITA:7928] of action ( karma yoga ) and the path of knowledge ( jnana yoga ). Further,
[GITA:7929] the characteristics of a seeker who is on a  journey to self -realization were
[GITA:7930] broadly identified as one having detachment from outcomes of action
[GITA:7931] (sanyasa) and perform ing prescribed duties ( yoga) as an offering to the
[GITA:7932] Lord. This was briefly described in verse 2.39 . Yoga as described here
[GITA:7933] prepares a seeker to learn more about the greatness of the Lord which is
[GITA:7934] covered in detail in chapters 7 to 12. This chapter delves m ore into the
[GITA:7935] details of yoga (action) and its components. Yoga has two components –
[GITA:7936] external and internal. The external component of yoga refers to the
[GITA:7937] prescribed activities that one must perform that are visible to others. For
[GITA:7938] example, Arjuna waging the w ar to protect his citizens from the Kauravas’
[GITA:7939] misrule. This aspect of yoga was briefly described in verse 2.45  and was
[GITA:7940] expanded in chapters 3 to 5. The internal component of yoga is termed
[GITA:7941] dhyana yoga (path of meditation), This is also an essential aspect of yoga
[GITA:7942] and was briefly described in verse 5.27 . This chapter delves into details of
[GITA:7943] dhyana yoga . Characteristics of a true yogi are described. The physical
[GITA:7944] aspects of meditation such as place, physical pose, breath control etc., are
[GITA:7945] also described. Requir ements for moderation in consumption are also
[GITA:7946] discussed. To a question from Arjuna regarding the condition of those who
[GITA:7947] make a sincere attempt but are not able to successfully implement karma
[GITA:7948] and dhyana, the Lord teaches that no  sincere effort is a waste, and such
[GITA:7949] seekers will get additional opportunities to complete their spiritual journey.
[GITA:7966] 164                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita

[GITA:7972] The Lord said:  One who performs prescribed duties without
[GITA:7973] expectations is both a real ascetic and a real yogi; not the one who has
[GITA:7974] simply relinquished performing ritual fire sacrifices. (6.1).
[GITA:7976] Comments: As indicated before, this chapter delves into details of
[GITA:7977] dhyana yoga, or the internal component of yoga (path of action). When is a
[GITA:7978] seeker eligible to follow the path of dhyana (meditation) which prepares
[GITA:7979] one to learn about the qualities of  the Lord? This verse states that a true
[GITA:7980] seeker who has both detachment towards outcomes of actions  and
[GITA:7981] commitment to performing prescribed duties is ready and eligible for
[GITA:7982] dhyana yoga.
[GITA:7984] Some schools such as sankhya, hold the view that ascetics who have
[GITA:7985] relinquished ritual fire sacrifices are the only ones eligible for dhyana yoga.
[GITA:7986] This verse clarifies  that even ascetics have obligations to perform
[GITA:7987] sacrifices such as worship of the  Lord, learning and preaching scripture s
[GITA:7988] etc., as was stated in verse 4.25 . Hence all seekers (including ascetics,  and
[GITA:7989] householders) are eligible for dhyana yoga if they perform their prescribed
[GITA:7990] duties without expectations.

[GITA:7995] O Pandava (Arjuna)! Understand that relinquishing passions such as
[GITA:7996] desire and anger (detachment) is an integral part of karma yoga. One who
[GITA:7997] is performing activities without getting rid of desire is not a real yogi. (6.2)
[GITA:8010] Chapter 6                                                                                                                                             165
[GITA:8012] Comments: Previous verses stated that a real seeker has both the
[GITA:8013] characteristics of detachment from outcomes and commitment to
[GITA:8014] performing prescribed activities, which are broadly termed sanyasa and
[GITA:8015] yoga. To emphasize the fact that these are not separate paths, this verse
[GITA:8016] explicitly states that sanyasa as described here is an essential component of
[GITA:8017] yoga.

[GITA:8022] For the one who has indirect knowledge (through scriptures) of the
[GITA:8023] Lord, the path of achieving direct, divine knowledge is through the path of
[GITA:8024] action. One who has achieved direct knowledge of the Lord, through
[GITA:8025] steadfast pr ayer and meditation, will experience exuberance in bliss upon
[GITA:8026] liberation. (6.3)
[GITA:8028] Comments: Knowledge is of two types. Indirect knowledge
[GITA:8029] (paroksha jnana) is the knowledge that a seeker acquires through study of
[GITA:8030] scriptures, from listening to teachers etc. T his knowledge helps t he seeker
[GITA:8031] to get rid of ignorance that cover s innate knowledge (verse 5.16). A seeker
[GITA:8032] armed with such indirect knowledge, by practicing sanyasa and yoga, will
[GITA:8033] be eligible for self-realization through direct, divine knowledge ( aparoksha
[GITA:8034] jnana). Will an aparoksha jnani indulge in activities and if so, what is to be
[GITA:8035] gained? This verse builds  upon the description in verse 3.20  and clarifies
[GITA:8036] that an aparoksha jnani continues to perform activities to set an example to
[GITA:8037] the society. Such action s are not wasted efforts but will result in increased
[GITA:8038] exuberance in bliss upon liberation. There is another difference in duties
[GITA:8039] performed by paroksha and aparoksha jnanis . The former needs to also
[GITA:8040] engage in service to society to help those in need (just a s one needs to pay
[GITA:8041] taxes). The latter does not have such  a broad mandate but needs to serve
[GITA:8042] superior souls.

[GITA:8064] Comments: This verse describes the characteristics of a realized
[GITA:8065] soul (aparoksha jnani ) who has attained direct, divi ne knowledge. Such a

[GITA:8067] from actions. This is different from other seekers who are yet to reach this
[GITA:8068] stage. These other seekers may also have developed aversion to sense
[GITA:8069] pleasures, but such aversion does not come to them naturally. They must
[GITA:8070] actively practice control of sense organs.

[GITA:8081] Comments: The next few verses describe the role of the mind in a
[GITA:8082] seeker’s evolution. The specialty of this verse is that it ha s 7 repetitions of
[GITA:8083] the word ‘atma’. This is a remarkably interesting word i n Sanskrit that has
[GITA:8084] different meanings such as – self, Lord Almighty, mind, intellect, devotion
[GITA:8085] etc. One can decipher the actual meaning only by looking at the context in
[GITA:8086] which this word is used. The above translation interprets the 7 occurrences
[GITA:8087] of atma as one, oneself, mind, mind, mind, one and mind.
[GITA:8089] Sri Rayaru [GV] provides an alternate meaning of this verse by
[GITA:8090] interpreting atma as the Lord Almighty in some places. T he Lord is o nes

[GITA:8111] indeed a friend. For one who cannot win over  the mind, it becomes an
[GITA:8112] enemy (the Lord becomes a friend to the devoted, and an enemy to those
[GITA:8113] not devoted). (6.6)
[GITA:8115] Comments: This verse provides the reason for the mind to be
[GITA:8116] someone’s friend or enemy. For one who has developed control over  the
[GITA:8117] mind using the intellect, the mind is a friend. For such a seeker, the mind is
[GITA:8118] a fertile ground for performing concentrated meditation on the Lord. For
[GITA:8119] one who has no control over the mind, the m ind itself becomes an enemy.
[GITA:8120] So, the mind is like a key, which can be used to both lock and open a door.
[GITA:8122] A second interpretation as per Sri Rayaru in GV is as follows: For a
[GITA:8123] seeker who has won over the Lord through devotion, the Lord becomes a
[GITA:8124] friend. Those who are not devoted to the Lord will have the Lord as their
[GITA:8125] enemy. In the above two interpretations the word ‘ atma’ has been
[GITA:8126] translated as intellect and devotion, respectively.

[GITA:8151] equipoised when facing extreme conditions such as cold/heat, p raise/insult,
[GITA:8152] happiness/sadness etc. The seeker also treats mud, stone, and gold equally
[GITA:8153] and is indeed the real yogi (6.7) (6.8)
[GITA:8155] Comments: Previous verses indicated that the mind and  the Lord
[GITA:8156] Almighty can be both friends and enemies . For a learned one who  has won
[GITA:8157] over both the mind (through intellect) and the Lord (through devotion), the
[GITA:8158] Lord is a friend.  These two verses describe the effect felt by such a seeker.
[GITA:8159] With the Lord manifesting in the heart of such a seeker (in other words
[GITA:8160] through the grace of  the Lord), the seeker will develop great patience and
[GITA:8161] equanimity in the face of extreme cold/heat, praise/insult etc. By acquiring
[GITA:8162] knowledge through spiritual studies ( indirect knowledge), a seeker
[GITA:8163] develops control over sense organs/mind and devotion to th e Lord, which
[GITA:8164] in turn allows the seeker to win over  the mind as well as the Lord. This
[GITA:8165] allows the seeker to realize the Lord (direct knowledge) , which in turn
[GITA:8166] equips the seeker with equanimity in the face of extreme situations.

[GITA:8181] The population that one deals with daily is categorized into seven types  -

[GITA:8196]  Well-wishers: Those who help others unconditionally
[GITA:8197]  Friends: Those who go out of their way to save others from danger
[GITA:8198]  Enemies: Those who always harm others
[GITA:8199]  Casual acquaintances: Those who neither help nor hurt.
[GITA:8200]  Middlemen: Those who help sometimes and harm sometimes
[GITA:8201]  Hateful: Those who hate others
[GITA:8202]  Family: Those who only help.
[GITA:8204] Everyone comes across these types of people daily and a real yogi treats
[GITA:8205] them fairly and equally according to the  guidelines in the scriptures.
[GITA:8206] Equality is recognizing that the Lord indwelling in everyone is equally
[GITA:8207] supreme with infinite auspicious attributes without blemish.

[GITA:8218] Comments: In verse 5.27 , the procedure for performi ng meditation
[GITA:8219] was briefly discussed. The next few verses provide more details on
[GITA:8220] meditation. To properly perform meditation, one must focus on three
[GITA:8221] aspects, mental, physical, and respiratory. The most difficult aspect to
[GITA:8222] control among these three is of co urse, the mental aspect. Hence, there has
[GITA:8223] been more emphasis on the impor tance of controlling one ’s mind. A yogi
[GITA:8224] engaged in meditation first finds a suitable, calm place to minimize
[GITA:8225] distractions from the external world.

[GITA:8251] of the yoga poses such as the lotus, the diamond etc.), with due control over
[GITA:8252] body and mind, and start meditation on the Lord for self-purification. (6.12)
[GITA:8254] Comments: For concentrated meditation , it is necessary to observe
[GITA:8255] personal cleanliness and cleanliness of the environment. For one to ensure a
[GITA:8256] clear mind and foc us on the Lord Almighty, it is important to ensure

[GITA:8269] With a clear, uncluttered mind, devoid of any fears from external
[GITA:8270] elements, focusing the mind on the Lord, keeping the sense organs from
[GITA:8271] straying, a seeker should meditate on Me (Lord Krishna) with firm

[GITA:8287] Comments: After preparing the physical apparatus (space, seat etc.),
[GITA:8288] the seeker is now ready to start meditation, observing physical discipline by
[GITA:8289] keeping body, head, and neck straight. It is also important to be free from
[GITA:8290] fears from external elements such as wild animals when performing
[GITA:8291] meditation. The Lord also says that the seeker should observe
[GITA:8292] brahmacharya which some interpret as celibacy. However, meditation
[GITA:8293] applies to all, not just  the unmarried . So, the real interpretation of the
[GITA:8294] brahmachari is brahma + achara, the one whose mind is active only on
[GITA:8295] topics related to the Lord (brahma).

[GITA:8331] O Arjuna! One cannot achieve benefits of such meditation if one
[GITA:8332] over eats or does not eat at all. Similarly, one who oversleeps or does not
[GITA:8333] sleep at all, will also lose all benefits from meditation. (6.16)
[GITA:8335] One who wishes to ben efit from such meditation should practice
[GITA:8336] moderation in eating, relaxing, sleeping, and other daily activities. (6.17)
[GITA:8338] Comments: These two verses describe the requirements for physical
[GITA:8339] wellbeing for a seeker to successfully perform concentrated meditation . It
[GITA:8340] is important for a seeker to ensure physical wellbeing by observing
[GITA:8341] moderation in habits such as eating, sleeping etc. It is evident from practice
[GITA:8342] that overeating leads to bodily discomfort. Similarly, oversleeping leads to
[GITA:8343] laziness and lethargy. Neit her of these conditions are conducive for
[GITA:8344] meditation. Likewise, one should not unnecessarily indulge in difficult,
[GITA:8345] strict fasting (as some do to reduce weight) as this can also have health
[GITA:8346] consequences. Basically, one needs to observe moderation in eating and
[GITA:8347] sleeping. However, those who are in good physical condition, should not

[GITA:8360] The condition of a person, who can meditate on the L ord with

[GITA:8421] This path that frees one completely from misery is the real yoga. A

[GITA:8425] Comments: These 4 verses describe the experience of a yogi who is

[GITA:8428]  the mind, which is under control, will not seek any outside material.
[GITA:8429]  the yogi experiences inner bliss by visualizing the Lord within.

[GITA:8432]  the mind is focused steadfastly on the Lord and does not stray.
[GITA:8433]  the yogi does not consider anything else as more valuable.

[GITA:8436] Sri Rayaru in GV  clarifies that this state of meditation not only helps a

[GITA:8470] step. After all, it is common even in worldly life for someone desirous of
[GITA:8471] achieving somethings to start by making a mental resolution to reach that
[GITA:8472] goal. The Lord recognizes that it is almost impossible for one to withdraw
[GITA:8473] the mind away from sense pleasure instantly. Hence, the advice to

[GITA:8486] The mind is ever wandering. The mind also cannot be empty. One way to

[GITA:8568] the universe. The Lord will take care of such a seeker who wil l always be

[GITA:8578] Comments: This verse discusses additional benefits from dhyana
[GITA:8579] meditation. A seeker performing such meditation with conviction about the
[GITA:8580] Lord’s presence in everyone will achieve moksha regardless of whether the
[GITA:8581] seeker has taken a just or an unjust path. Sri Rayaru clarifies in GV  that in
[GITA:8582] the latter case, the quantity of bliss experienced in moksha will be reduced.
[GITA:8583] Why do some realized souls take an unjust path? Many times, as in the case
[GITA:8584] of Bharata  and Ajamila, realized souls  indulged in undesirable activities
[GITA:8585] (a result of past action)  due to the will of the Lord . But they w ere
[GITA:8586] eventually shown the proper path by the Lord and ultimately achieve d
[GITA:8587] moksha. They would however experience a reduction in bliss in moksha.
[GITA:8589] Sri Padmanabha Teertha in his Gita commentary [GBB P], makes a
[GITA:8590] reference to verse 3.17  where a realized soul destined for moksha has no
[GITA:8591] obligations to perform any activities. Such a seeker will also eventually
[GITA:8592] reach the Lord even if that seeker had not performed any activities.

[GITA:8613] Comments: In this verse the Lord describes the characteristics of a
[GITA:8614] yogi who is superior to others. Such a seeker will wish for others what the
[GITA:8615] seeker would have wished for himself/herself and would see the sam e Lord
[GITA:8616] in everyone. Does it mean that the yogi will treat or consider everyo ne as
[GITA:8617] equal? No. Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies. The word sama or equal refers to the
[GITA:8618] same Lord that is present in everyone as indicated by the phrase ‘ ekatvam
[GITA:8619] asthita’ in the previous verse. The same Lord is present in everyone with
[GITA:8620] infinite auspicious attributes while being devoid of any blemishes.

[GITA:8651] Comments: Arjuna, after listening to Krishna’s teachings on dhyana
[GITA:8652] meditation expresses doubts about the ability of the mind to meditate with
[GITA:8653] full focus. The mind, by nature is fickle and is always wa vering. The mind
[GITA:8654] is extraordinarily st rong, and many times forces one ’s body and sense
[GITA:8655] organs astray. How ca n one control such a mind ? It would be like trying to
[GITA:8656] capture the wind. These are natural questions that would arise in a seeker.

[GITA:8665] The Lord said:  O Arjuna, One with Strong Arms! No doubt it is
[GITA:8666] exceedingly difficult to control the wavering mind. O Son of Kunti! It can
[GITA:8667] be controlled b y practice (of dhyana meditation) and de tachment (from
[GITA:8668] sense pleasures). (6.35)
[GITA:8670] One who cannot achieve control over the mind can never benefit
[GITA:8671] from meditation. One should strive to achieve mind -control through
[GITA:8672] continuous practice, focus and concentrated meditation. (6.36)
[GITA:8674] Comments: In these tw o verses, the Lord prescribes two ways for
[GITA:8675] one to achieve control over the mind. One would be to keep practicing
[GITA:8676] dhyana meditation and the other would be to develop detachment from
[GITA:8677] sense pleasures. Both these are not easy to achieve but one must strive to
[GITA:8678] continuously practice and over time one will be able to control one ’s mind.
[GITA:8679] It is evident from one ’s experience that one interested in learning any skill
[GITA:8680] in life such as sports or music, must continuously practice and never give
[GITA:8681] up. We see many examples of  high achievers who have excelled in their
[GITA:8682] chosen profession by sheer grit, determination, and constant practice. The
[GITA:8694] 180                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:8695] same qualities when applied to meditation and detachment will he lp one
[GITA:8696] develop control over one’s mind.
[GITA:8698] One can question as to why one wo uld need to develop detachment
[GITA:8699] by avoiding indulgence in sensual pleasures as one can wait for such time
[GITA:8700] till all desires are exhausted. Sri Jaya  Teertha in PD  uses the example of a
[GITA:8701] wayward, drunk elephant which naturally becomes tame with exhaustion.
[GITA:8702] But this is not true of sense organs. I t is impossible to satiate sense organs
[GITA:8703] by mere consumption. For example, one who craves good food and
[GITA:8704] consumes it in excess may temporarily feel satisfied and in fact may refuse
[GITA:8705] more food due to exhaustion. However, this  feeling does not last, and the
[GITA:8706] craving comes back the next day. So, one must continuously practice
[GITA:8707] detachment to achieve control over one’s mind.

[GITA:8745] of mind control. He realizes that many who are very sincere in their efforts
[GITA:8746] to traverse the spiritual path cannot achieve detachment even after trying.
[GITA:8747] What would happen to them , and are their efforts wasted? It appears, that
[GITA:8748] they would be denied the heavens and moksha because of their failure to
[GITA:8749] complete their prescribed duties or dhyana meditation. Or they will achieve
[GITA:8750] nothing of value in this life or after life. Will they wither away like clouds
[GITA:8751] scattered by a strong wind, or will they be relegate d to hell? Arjuna, who
[GITA:8752] had previously requested Krishna to help dispel his doubts in verses 2.7 and

[GITA:8763] Comments: The Lord answers Arjuna’s questions in the next four
[GITA:8764] and half verses. Arjuna’s questions were based on the following arguments.
[GITA:8765] Some seekers may avoid performing activities that would result in rewards
[GITA:8766] such as heavens , based on their belief that those rewards are temporary.
[GITA:8767] Given the difficulty in performing concentra ted meditation on the Lord,
[GITA:8768] they would also fail in dhyana meditation and would not be able to achieve
[GITA:8769] liberation. So, they would lose out on both.  Lord Krishna answers in verse
[GITA:8770] 6.40 stating that a seeker who has tried to perform prescribed activities,
[GITA:8771] meditation etc., will not experience any ill effects either in this world or
[GITA:8772] hereafter. They will not be denied birth in human species. And t hey will

[GITA:8900] are co nsidered superior by the Lord. Seekers who go a step further and
[GITA:8901] offer their service to the Lord are even more superior. Finally, seekers who
[GITA:8902] perform prescribed duties with devotion, with their minds fully immersed

[GITA:8925] Summary of Chapter 6
[GITA:8927] The previous chapters described the paths of action and knowledge
[GITA:8928] (karma yoga, jnana yoga). Yoga has two components – external (prescribed
[GITA:8929] activities that one performs  which are visible to others ) and internal . The
[GITA:8930] internal component of yoga is termed dhyana yoga  (path of meditation),
[GITA:8931] This chapter delves into details of dhyana yoga or atma samyama yoga (the
[GITA:8932] Path of Self -Restraint). The Lord starts by stating that a real  yogi is one
[GITA:8933] who relinquishes expectations from actions and not one who merely gives
[GITA:8934] up ritual fire sacrifices (6.1). Such a seeker also has societal obligations to
[GITA:8935] help the underprivileged (6.3). A seeker must exercise control over the
[GITA:8936] sense organs and the mind. The importance of  the mind which can be both
[GITA:8937] a friend and a foe to a seeker is explained in verses 6.5–6.8. A yogi sees the
[GITA:8938] Lord equally in everyone. The process of meditation in terms of location,
[GITA:8939] physical pose etc., are described in verses 6.10 –6.14. Successful meditation
[GITA:8940] also requires moderation in activities such a s eating, sleeping etc. Verses
[GITA:8941] 6.20-6.23 describe the nature of inner bliss experienced by a yogi during
[GITA:8942] dhyana meditation. The requirement for controlling  the sense organs and
[GITA:8943] the mind for successful medi tation are described in verses 6.24 -6.32.
[GITA:8944] Arjuna expresses the difficulty one would face in controlling the mind in
[GITA:8945] verses 6.33 -6.34, and Lord Krishna describes  the solution for the fate of
[GITA:8946] those seekers who may sincerely approach  the spiritual path but are not
[GITA:8947] able to execute it for various reasons. In verses 6.40 -6.45, the Lord assures
[GITA:8948] that no sincere efforts are wasted, and the seeker will get additional

[GITA:8970] Chapter 7 - The Path of Knowledge and Wisdom
[GITA:8972] Chapter Introduction: In this chapter of 30 verses, the Lord teaches
[GITA:8973] the concepts of jnana (knowledge) and vijnana (special knowledge or
[GITA:8974] wisdom). In verse 2.39, the Lord stated that He w ould teach about the yoga
[GITA:8975] (way or path) to achieve divine, spiritual knowledge, knowing which one
[GITA:8976] would be able to properly perform prescribed duties, get rid of accrued sins ,
[GITA:8977] and achieve liberation. Such procedures were described from chapters 2 to
[GITA:8978] 6. The  path described had two components, external and internal. The
[GITA:8979] external component dealt with the procedures to be performed, and this was
[GITA:8980] covered till chapter 5. Chapter 6 dealt with the internal procedure of
[GITA:8981] dhyana meditation that a seeker needs to perfor m. Thus, the first 6 chapters
[GITA:8982] were broadly concerned with descriptions of the  methods and procedures
[GITA:8983] (both external and internal) a seeker would need to perform to be able to
[GITA:8984] acquire divine, spiritual knowledge. The next 6 chapters describe in more
[GITA:8985] detail such divine, spiritual knowledge about the Lord Almighty , which
[GITA:8986] forms the principal message of the Gita. In the earlier chapters 2 – 6, there
[GITA:8987] were some discussions on the Lord’s attributes which were included
[GITA:8988] contextually, but the next 6 chapters provide m ore, exclusive details about
[GITA:8989] the Lord’s attributes. The term jnana in general means ordinary knowledge,
[GITA:8990] which is acquired through the study of scriptures, learning from teachers
[GITA:8991] etc. This is also known as paroksha jnana  (indirect knowledge) , as one
[GITA:8992] acquires this before attaining self -realization. Vijnana is specialis ed
[GITA:8993] knowledge or wisdom acquired after self -realization. This is also known as
[GITA:8994] aparoksha jnana  (direct knowledge). This chapter provides a detailed
[GITA:8995] discussion of the se two types of knowledge .  The two types of knowledge
[GITA:8996] are specifically about the Lord Almighty.
[GITA:9012] Chapter 7                                                                                                                                             187

[GITA:9019] The Lord said:  O Partha! With your mind fully absorbed in  Me,
[GITA:9020] seeking refuge in Me, meditate on Me.  Listen to Me to understand the way
[GITA:9021] (yoga) you can extensively know Me, dispelling all the doubts. (7.1)
[GITA:9022] Comments: The Lord starts His sermon to Arjuna about His
[GITA:9023] attributes. To understand these, seekers would require th eir mind s to be
[GITA:9024] completely focused on the Lord with firm conviction that the Lord is the
[GITA:9025] protector and shelter for all. The Lord uses the adjectives asamshayam
[GITA:9026] (without doubt) and samagram (complete) in this verse. Sri Madhwacharya
[GITA:9027] in his GB  clarifies that these words cannot be interpreted to conclude that
[GITA:9028] one can completely understand the Lord. Rather they refer to the
[GITA:9029] knowledge that a seeker can acquire, meaning that by listening to the
[GITA:9030] Lord’s teachings attentively, a seeker can understand the Lord’s attr ibutes
[GITA:9031] to the maximum extent (based on the seeker’s abilities). Even deities such
[GITA:9032] as Rudra, Brahma etc., cannot completely comprehend the Lord’s attributes
[GITA:9033] which are infinite.

[GITA:9040] Comments: The Lord states the two types of knowle dge that He
[GITA:9041] would be imparting. Jnana refers to ordinary or indirect knowledge
[GITA:9042] (paroksha jnana ) which one normally acquires through studies of
[GITA:9043] scriptures, learning from teachers etc. Vijnana = vishesha jnana  refers to
[GITA:9055] 188                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:9056] specialized knowledge which refers to the direct knowledge ( aparoksha
[GITA:9057] jnana) that one would acquire after having been blessed with a vision of the
[GITA:9058] Lord.

[GITA:9069] Comments: Among the masses, only very few will have the
[GITA:9070] inclination to learn about th e Lord , and among them even fewer will
[GITA:9071] succeed in gaining some knowledge. Among those who have learnt
[GITA:9072] something, very few would have properly learnt about the Lord’s attributes.
[GITA:9073] Again, it should be noted that knowing properly about the Lord’s attributes
[GITA:9074] does not equate to knowing fully about the Lord. One can learn properly
[GITA:9075] only about a fraction of the Lord’s attributes.

[GITA:9085] Comments: In verse 7.2, the Lord resolves to teach Arjuna ordinary
[GITA:9086] knowledge (jnana) first, and later specialized, divine knowledge ( vijnana).
[GITA:9087] That teaching starts from this verse  onwards. Previously, in verse 5.29  and
[GITA:9088] others, it was stated that the Lord is the Lord of everyone and everything in
[GITA:9089] the universe. The next few verses provide more details on the components
[GITA:9101] Chapter 7                                                                                                                                             189
[GITA:9103] of the universe which are  all under the control of  the Lord. This verse
[GITA:9104] explicitly states that inert nature which is made up of the basic elements
[GITA:9105] (earth, fire, water, wind, space) and the principles of mind, individuation,
[GITA:9106] and intellect are all under the control of the Lord. Sri Rayaru clarifies in
[GITA:9107] GV, quoting from GB  that the principle of individuation (ahankara) also
[GITA:9108] includes the superior principle of cosmic intelligence (mahat).

[GITA:9116] who provides shelter to all  and supports the entire univ erse. The Lord is
[GITA:9117] superior to Goddess Mahalakshmi and all liberated souls who have
[GITA:9118] achieved moksha. (7.5)
[GITA:9120] Comments: In the previous verse 7.4 , the Lord described the
[GITA:9121] components of inert nature and indicated that they all act under His control.
[GITA:9122] In this verse, He identifies other, sentient components of the universe such
[GITA:9123] as individual souls, liberated souls, and the ever -liberated Goddess
[GITA:9124] Mahalakshmi, and clarifies that they too are under His control.

[GITA:9130] Through these two aspects of nature, I am responsible for the creation and

[GITA:9133] Comments: The universe is made up of inert matter  and sent ient
[GITA:9134] nature. Lord Krishna further clarifies that not only are the components of
[GITA:9135] the universe under His control, but He is also responsible for the creation
[GITA:9136] and dissolution of the universe. The Lord states ‘ aham prabhavaha
[GITA:9148] 190                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:9149] pralayaha’, which literally means , ‘I am creation a nd dissolution’. Sri
[GITA:9150] Rayaru in GV quoting Sri Madhwacharya’s GB  clarifies that the actual
[GITA:9151] meaning of this phrase is ‘I am responsible for creation and dissolution’
[GITA:9152] stating that the phrase is used in a figurative sense. For example, it is
[GITA:9153] common for many to refer to a kingdom by the name of its king. This is
[GITA:9154] done in the context of a king who has full control over his kingdom.

[GITA:9161] O Dhananjaya! There is no entity in this universe that is superior to
[GITA:9162] Me (Lord Krishna). Everything in the universe is supported by Me, just like
[GITA:9163] a garland of pearls is supported by a string. (7.7)
[GITA:9165] Comments: This verse is one of the most quoted verses in the Gita
[GITA:9166] as it emphatically captures the Lord’s declaration that He is the Supreme
[GITA:9167] One, and everything and everyone in the universe are under His control – in
[GITA:9168] other words, the principle of Vishnu’s Supremacy ( Vishnu Sarvottamatva).
[GITA:9169] When the Lord indicates  that everythin g in the universe act s under His
[GITA:9170] control and He is responsible for the universe’s creation and dissolution, He
[GITA:9171] clarifies that there is no one superior to Him and He is also responsible for
[GITA:9172] the sustenance of the universe. Any confusion that some may have th at
[GITA:9173] perhaps Maya (or illusion) covers even the Lord, is categorically dispelled
[GITA:9174] here.
[GITA:9176] It is interesting to note the simile of a bunch of pearls supported by a
[GITA:9177] string is used here to describe the Lord supporting the universe. While one
[GITA:9178] can see pearls worn by someone, the string is not visible. But if the string
[GITA:9179] were to snap, the pearls will not hold together. Similarly, while the Lord
[GITA:9180] supports the universe, one cannot see Him. He indeed works in mysterious
[GITA:9181] ways.
[GITA:9193] Chapter 7                                                                                                                                             191
[GITA:9195] Author’s Note: This is also an interesting v erse from the perspective
[GITA:9196] of numerology. Number 7 is considered very auspicious, and Gita has 700
[GITA:9197] verses. The fact that the Lord’s supremacy is demonstrated in the 7 th verse
[GITA:9198] of the 7th chapter is worth noting.

[GITA:9207] Comments: In verse 7.2 , the Lord resolved to teach Arjuna both
[GITA:9208] indirect (ordinary) knowledge ( jnana) and direct (special, divine)
[GITA:9209] knowledge (vijnana). Some aspects of indirect knowledge were covered in
[GITA:9210] verses 7.4 – 7.7. In the next few verses, the Lord provides more specialized
[GITA:9211] details about His attributes and glories which form specialized knowledge
[GITA:9212] (vijnana). In verses 7.4 – 7.7, the Lord states that everything and everyone
[GITA:9213] in the universe act under His ownership and control. In the next few verses,
[GITA:9214] He provides more details ab out the meaning of ownership. The basic
[GITA:9215] elements of nature such as water, fire etc., are under His control , and in
[GITA:9216] addition, the Lord owns and powers the essence in these elements. The
[GITA:9217] Lord provides the character of sweetness to water; hence He is known as
[GITA:9218] sweetness. Likewise, He powers the radiance in the Sun and the Moon. He
[GITA:9219] is also known as Om, the primordial syllable which is the root for all Vedic
[GITA:9220] literature. The syllable Om is made up of 3 letters; a, u, and ma, and these
[GITA:9221] gave rise to the triumvirate in the holy hymn, Gayatri which in turn gave
[GITA:9222] rise to the 3 parts of the Purusha Sookta hymns from the Vedas, from
[GITA:9223] which arose  Vedic literature. The Lord also empowers virility in humans.

[GITA:9240] I am the fragrance on earth. I am the brilliance in fire. I am the life in
[GITA:9241] living beings. I am the austerity in ascetics. (7.9)
[GITA:9243] Comments: The Lord causes and consumes the pleasant fragrance in
[GITA:9244] earthly material. The reason for the use of  the adjective pleasant is to
[GITA:9245] clarify that earthly materials emanate different smells, and the Lord
[GITA:9246] consumes only pleasant fragrance. Fire has both radiance and energy. In the
[GITA:9247] previous verse, it was stated that the Lord is responsible for the radiance in
[GITA:9248] luminous objects such as the S un, the M oon and Fire. Here He is
[GITA:9249] confirming that even the energy in these objects are due to Him alone. The
[GITA:9250] Lord has special affection for ascetics who are constantly meditating on
[GITA:9251] Him. He states that He powers the austerity in ascetics.

[GITA:9259] also of their strength and qualities). (7.10)
[GITA:9261] Comments: The Lord has stated previously that all objects in the
[GITA:9262] universe such as the five basic elements of nature, the Sun, the Moon etc.,
[GITA:9263] are all under His control. In addition, He has separately clarified in verses
[GITA:9264] 7.8 onwards, that not only are all objects under His control, their innate
[GITA:9265] attributes (such as sweetness in water, radiance/energy in fire) are also due
[GITA:9266] to Him alone. A tailor de signs a dress using basic materials such as cloth,
[GITA:9267] thread etc., and the finished dress has all characteristics of its ingredients
[GITA:9268] such as softness, strength etc. The tailor gets the credit for creating the
[GITA:9269] dress, but he ha s no role in the presence of the i nnate qualities of the
[GITA:9270] ingredients. The Lord is not like the tailor in this example. He not only is
[GITA:9271] responsible for the creation of   objects but is also responsible for the innate
[GITA:9272] qualities in those objects. These aspects form part of vijnana, which is
[GITA:9273] specialized knowledge about the Lord’s greatness. A seeker needs to

[GITA:9287] understand this, and only then will he be able to develop trust and faith in
[GITA:9288] worshipping the Lord. Sri Rayaru in GV  also interprets this verse to
[GITA:9289] indicate that even deities who govern the in trinsic attributes of objects are
[GITA:9290] under the Lord’s control.

[GITA:9299] Comments: The Lord who is devoid of any defects or weaknesses
[GITA:9300] represents the positive attributes in individuals such as strength in powerful
[GITA:9301] people who do not use such strength for negative p urposes. One should

[GITA:9312] Comments: In verses 7.8 – 7.11, the Lord states  that He is the
[GITA:9313] essence of all objects, and identifies them  by way of examples: sweetness
[GITA:9314] in water, radiance in fire, the primordial symbol Om in the scriptures,
[GITA:9315] intelligence in the wise, strength in the powerful, etc. On the surface, these
[GITA:9316] verses seem to indicate  the Lord’s identity with these attributes. While
[GITA:9317] these attributes were created by and act under the control of the L ord, they
[GITA:9318] are not identical to the Lord. This verse clarifies this relationship by clearly
[GITA:9319] stating that all objects in the universe comprised of the triumvirate of
[GITA:9320] attributes (sattv, rajas, tamas) are under His control. The Lord further states
[GITA:9332] 194                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:9333] that He is not dependent on them and rather, they all depend on Him, thus
[GITA:9334] making it abundantly clear that these objects and attributes are not identical
[GITA:9335] to Him but in fact owe their existence to Him.

[GITA:9346] Comments:  How can the world made up of the three qualities come
[GITA:9347] under delusion and not realize the Lord as being beyond the three qualities?
[GITA:9348] Sri Rayaru in GV  explains that people look at other people in the world
[GITA:9349] whose physical bodies are made up of the three qualities. They conclude
[GITA:9350] that similarly, the Lord’s body could also be made up of these three
[GITA:9351] qualities. However, learned ones understand that the Lord’s body i s
[GITA:9352] transcendental in nature and is not subject to birth or decay or destruct ion.
[GITA:9353] The Lord who has limitless auspicious attributes is beyond the three
[GITA:9354] qualities of nature. This concept is also part of vijnana (specialized
[GITA:9355] knowledge about the Lord).
[GITA:9357] While the Lord, during His incarnation in this world as Rama or
[GITA:9358] Krishna, looks and acts like any other human being, from time to time He

[GITA:9360] capacity) which are described in epics such as the Mahabharata. Hence, a

[GITA:9384] Comments: What causes delusion in people? This verse answers by
[GITA:9385] stating that delusion is due to the influence of the three qualities of sattv,
[GITA:9386] rajas and tamas and they are caused by Nature presided over by Goddess
[GITA:9387] Durga (as per Sri Rayaru [GV]). How can one overcome such delusion? As
[GITA:9388] Maya operates under the control of the Lord, one must surrender to the
[GITA:9389] Lord to be freed from delusion.

[GITA:9400] following this advice? The Lord responds by stating that individuals who

[GITA:9402] prevents them from acquiring proper kn owledge of Him. They have a
[GITA:9403] demoniac nature and hence do not surrender to Him and are not able to

[GITA:9425] seeking spiritual knowledge, those seeking riches and the learned ones
[GITA:9426] (who have already acquired spiritual knowledge). (7.16)
[GITA:9428] Comments: The previous verse describes  sinful people who do not
[GITA:9429] surrender to the Lord. This verse describes the categories of people who are
[GITA:9430] devoted to the Lord. These largely consist of those who have some physical
[GITA:9431] ailment, those who are seeking material wealth, tho se who are desirous of
[GITA:9432] spiritual knowledge and those who have acquired divine, spiritual
[GITA:9433] knowledge. The Lord’s devotees who pray to the Lord in times of distress
[GITA:9434] do so as they would like to continue performing their prescribed duty as an
[GITA:9435] offering to Him and this would require them to be freed from distress .
[GITA:9436] Devotees who pray for wealth do so to help them acquire the means to
[GITA:9437] perform activities pleasing to the Lord, such as charity.  Learned ones pray
[GITA:9438] for self-realization.

[GITA:9447] Comments: Among these four types of devotees, is there a
[GITA:9448] gradation? The Lord states that among these types, learned ones who have
[GITA:9449] acquired divine, spiritual knowledge are the most superior. They have two
[GITA:9450] main characteristics – (a) their minds are exclusively focused o n the Lord,
[GITA:9451] and (b) they are exclusively devoted to the Lord. The Lord declares that

[GITA:9470] All these four types  of people are certainly worthy. But learned ones
[GITA:9471] are like My own form. They surrender to Me completely and constantly
[GITA:9472] meditate on Me and eventually reach the highest state of bliss. (7.18)
[GITA:9474] Comments: If learned ones are superior among the four and the
[GITA:9475] Lord is fond of them, how about the other types? The Lord states that all
[GITA:9476] four types are superior devotees, but among them learned ones are the most
[GITA:9477] superior.
[GITA:9479] This verse uses the phrase ‘atma eva’ when describing learned ones.
[GITA:9480] Some philosophers interpret ‘ atma eva ’ to mean ‘My own form’ quoting
[GITA:9481] the text ‘ nama roopevihaya ’ from the Atharva Upanishat  (6.8) in
[GITA:9482] reference to rivers merging in an ocean and apparently losing their identity.
[GITA:9483] Sri Vidyasagara Madhava Te ertha quotes Sri Madhwacharya’s
[GITA:9484] interpretation of  this Upanishat and points out that the proper word
[GITA:9485] derivation of the above text is ‘ nama roope Savihaya’ = nama roope
[GITA:9486] avihaya, which indicates that rivers maintain their identity even when they
[GITA:9487] merge with the ocean. The proper interpretation of the phrase ‘atma eva’ is
[GITA:9488] that learned ones are extremely dear to the Lord.

[GITA:9497] world. (7.19)
[GITA:9499] Comments: Why will everyone not reach moksha? This verse

[GITA:9563] Comments: There are broadly two types of devotees which are not
[GITA:9564] mutually exclusive. Shuddha Bhagavathas  (Pure Devotees of Lord
[GITA:9565] Almighty) and Mishrayajees (devotees of other deiti es). Verse 7.19
[GITA:9566] describes the characteristics of learned ones and they belong  to the class of
[GITA:9567] Shuddha Bhagavathas . Among Mishrayajees (Mishra = mixed; yajee =
[GITA:9568] worshipper), there are two types. The first category is the so called
[GITA:9569] Trividyas (those who perfor m rituals based on the peripheral meanings of
[GITA:9570] the three Vedas). They believe that the purpose of  the Vedas is to help one
[GITA:9571] acquire material riches and they accordingly perform Vedic rituals to
[GITA:9572] propitiate lesser deities to get their desires fulfilled. Even i n this case, the
[GITA:9573] actual rewards are granted by the Lord using lesser deities as the medium.
[GITA:9574] The second category of Mishrayajees are really Shuddha Bhagavathas who
[GITA:9575] are pure devotees of the Lord, but for various reasons also propitiat e other
[GITA:9576] deities. They will over the time receive proper guidance from a teacher and
[GITA:9577] will focus on worship of the Lord without expectation and will ultimately
[GITA:9578] achieve moksha.

[GITA:9583] Those who propitiate other deities due to their limited understanding,
[GITA:9584] will receive only minimum, temporary fruits. On the other hand, those who
[GITA:9585] are primarily devoted to Me will ultimately reach Me and experience
[GITA:9586] eternal bliss. (7.23)
[GITA:9588] Comments: If propitiating other deitie s results in rewards, why
[GITA:9589] should one focus on propitiating the Lord Almighty alone? This verse
[GITA:9590] answers by stating that one who propitiates only other, lesser deities will
[GITA:9591] receive only temporary fruits. Even if they reach the worlds of other deities
[GITA:9592] after their time on earth, their stay in those worlds will be temporary. On
[GITA:9593] the other hand, devote es who primarily worship the Lord Almighty will
[GITA:9594] eventually attain the Lord’s abode permanently. Sri Rayaru clari fies in GV
[GITA:9595] that it is not prohibited for one to worsh ip other deities; one should worship
[GITA:9607] 200                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita

[GITA:9609] not separately.

[GITA:9620] Comments: What separates the Lord Almighty from other deities?
[GITA:9621] Why do those who propitiate other deit ies receive temporary rewards,
[GITA:9622] while those who worship the Lord Almighty receive permanent bliss? This
[GITA:9623] verse answers these questions. Ignorant ones (termed abuddhayas) do not
[GITA:9624] realize that the Lord Almighty is supreme, has no births, and does not have
[GITA:9625] a perishable body. They perceive the Lord as having perishable existence.
[GITA:9627] Sri Rayaru in GV  provides a second interpretation for this verse as
[GITA:9628] follows – Ignorant ones who are not able to comprehend the Lord’s
[GITA:9629] supremacy or His infinite, auspicious attributes , regard Him as identical to
[GITA:9630] individual souls.
[GITA:9632] In summary, verses 7.20 to 7.24  describe the characteristics of the
[GITA:9633] three types of beings: Shuddha Bhagavathas  (sattvic), Trividyas (rajasic),
[GITA:9634] and Abuddhayas (tamasic). This concept is covered in detail in Chapter 17.

[GITA:9655] Comments: Why are some not able to acquire proper understanding
[GITA:9656] of the Lord’s attributes? This verse states that one can only imbibe
[GITA:9657] knowledge based on one’s innate nature. It is due to the will of  the Lord
[GITA:9658] Almighty and Goddess Durga ’s form of MahaLakshmi (who operates
[GITA:9659] under the control of Lord as per verse 7.14) that the ignorant are not able to
[GITA:9660] acquire proper understanding of the Lord’s attributes. Does it cause
[GITA:9661] concern to the Lord that some ascribe wrong qual ities on Him? No. It is the
[GITA:9662] Lord Himself who causes such ignorance to the undeserving.
[GITA:9664] The word yogamaya is interpreted as ‘ yoga sahita maya’ , where
[GITA:9665] yoga refers to the Lord’s infinite strength and maya refers to Goddess
[GITA:9666] Durga. As per Sri Madhwacharya [GB] , Sri Jaya  Teertha [PD], and Sri
[GITA:9667] Rayaru [GV], yoga can be interpreted to mean either upaya (means or
[GITA:9668] instrument) or strength ( shakti). However, in this verse, the interpretation
[GITA:9669] of yoga as strength is correct as maya already represents the instrument
[GITA:9670] (upaya) of strength. This interpretation is also supported by Padma
[GITA:9671] Purana.

[GITA:9710] Comments: In verses 7.14 and 7.25 , it was stat ed that the prime

[GITA:9715] An alt ernate i nterpretation by Sri Rayaru in GV based on Sri
[GITA:9716] Madhwacharya’s GB and GTN is as follows:  the primary reason for one’s

[GITA:9791] 204                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:9792] such as Brahma, Karma, Adhyatma, Adhibhoota, Adhidaiva and Adhiyajna.
[GITA:9793] Remembering this knowledge especially during the time a seeker leaves the
[GITA:9794] body will ensure that the seeker will attain the Lord. These concepts are
[GITA:9795] described in more detail in the next chapter.
[GITA:9797] Summary of Chapter 7
[GITA:9799] The first 6 chapters were broadly concerned with descriptions o f the
[GITA:9800] methods and procedures ( both external and internal) that a seeker would
[GITA:9801] need to perform to be able to acquire divine, spiritual knowledge. The next
[GITA:9802] 6 chapters describe in more detail such divine, spiritual knowledge about
[GITA:9803] the Lord, which forms the principal message of the Gita. In earlier chapters
[GITA:9804] 2 – 6, there were some discussions on the Lord’s attributes which were
[GITA:9805] included contextually, and the next 6 chapters provide more  exclusive
[GITA:9806] details about the Lord’ attributes. Chapter 7 provides a detailed discussion
[GITA:9807] of the two types of learning – knowledge and wisdom. Ordinary knowledge
[GITA:9808] (jnana) is that knowledge that is gained from scriptural studies and through
[GITA:9809] teachers. Wisdom or d irect knowledge ( vijnana) is specialized knowledge
[GITA:9810] about the Lord Almighty that one can attain aft er self-realization. In verses
[GITA:9811] 7.4 - 7.6, the components of the eight -fold nature in the univ erse are
[GITA:9812] identified. In verses 7.7  - 7.11, the Lord describes His ownership of
[GITA:9813] everything in the universe and stresses that He is responsible for even the
[GITA:9814] intrinsic attri butes of objects. The cause of ignorance, the influence of
[GITA:9815] delusion on living beings , and procedure to overcome delusio n are also
[GITA:9816] discussed in verses 7.13 – 7.14. The various types of seekers who are
[GITA:9817] devoted to the Lord are identified in verses 7.16 – 7.19 as those in sickness,
[GITA:9818] those seeking spiritual knowledge, those seeking riches, and those who
[GITA:9819] have already acquired divine, spiritual knowledge . Among these four types
[GITA:9820] of devotees, the Lord is fond of the last type who worship Him without any
[GITA:9821] expectations. Verses 7.20 – 7.23 deal with worshippers of other deities in
[GITA:9822] comparison with those who are exclusively devoted to the Lord Almighty.
[GITA:9823] Those who only worship other deities may receive temporary fruits and
[GITA:9835] Chapter 7                                                                                                                                             205
[GITA:9837] those who exclusively worship the Lord Almighty ultimately attain
[GITA:9838] everlasting bliss. In verses 7.24 - 7.26, the issue of false knowledge is
[GITA:9839] described. In verse 7.28 , the Lord exhorts the virtuous to overcome false
[GITA:9840] knowledge and worship Him with conviction. The chapter ends with a
[GITA:9841] message from the Lord in ve rses 7.29 – 7.30 about the thoughts that a
[GITA:9842] seeker should focus on at the time of leaving this world. These last two
[GITA:9843] verses act as a bridge to the next chapter where the concepts introduced
[GITA:9844] here are dealt with in detail.

[GITA:9861] Chapter 8 - The Imperishable Lord
[GITA:9863] Chapter Introduction: This chapter, titled Akshara Brahma Yoga ,
[GITA:9864] the path of  the imperishable Lord , comprising 28 verses , shows the sure
[GITA:9865] path to reach the Lord through concentrated meditatio n and single pointed
[GITA:9866] devotion. The previous chapter covered the issues of  indirect knowledge
[GITA:9867] and direct knowledge as they relate to  the Lord. Towards the  end of the
[GITA:9868] chapter, in verses 7.29 and 7.30 , the Lord introduced some special topics
[GITA:9869] such as Adhibhoota, Adhidaiva, Adhiyajna, etc. This terminology was used
[GITA:9870] for the first time , and Arjuna naturally has questions about its  context and
[GITA:9871] meaning. The Lord answers Arjuna’s questions, and much of the chapter is
[GITA:9872] devoted to the act of remembering the Lord during one’s final moments and
[GITA:9873] one’s journey hereafter.

[GITA:9884] Arjuna said, “O Purushottama (The Supreme One)! ” Who is Brahma

[GITA:9886] (Fruitive Action)? What does one call Adhibhoota (Prime Nature)? Who
[GITA:9887] are ‘Adhidaiva’ (Prime Deities)? 8.1
[GITA:9889] O Madhusoodana! Who is known as Adhiyajna (Lord of Sacrifice) in
[GITA:9890] this body? And why? How are you to be known at the time  of departure by
[GITA:9891] yogis (seekers) with self-control? (8.2)
[GITA:9904] Chapter 8                                                                                                                                          207
[GITA:9906] Comments: In verse 7.30 , the Lord stated the need for one to have
[GITA:9907] proper knowledge about Him, especially during one’s last moments. Arjuna
[GITA:9908] has eight questions re garding the concepts in verses 7.29 and 7.30 . Lord
[GITA:9909] Krishna answers these questions in the next few verses.

[GITA:9917] The Lord said: Brahma refers to the imperishable Lord who pervades
[GITA:9918] everything and everyone. Adhyatma refers to the material equipment  that
[GITA:9919] allows a soul to act (body, sens e organs, conscience). Karma refers to the
[GITA:9920] Lord’s act of creation, which is responsible for the birth and e xistence of all
[GITA:9921] living beings. 8.3
[GITA:9923] Comments: The Lord responds to each of Arjuna’s eight questions.
[GITA:9925]  Brahma refers to the imperishable Lord Almighty . The adjective
[GITA:9926] param (meaning supreme) is used here to denote the Lord Almighty ,
[GITA:9927] as there are other imperishable (akshara) entities also in the universe
[GITA:9928] such as inert nature, the letters, the Vedas, etc. (verse 2.17)  which
[GITA:9929] are dependent on the Lord
[GITA:9930]  Adhyatma (prime self) refers to material equipment that helps a soul
[GITA:9931] function in this world: the physical body, sense organs, and
[GITA:9932] conscience (which the Lord grants according to a soul’s svabhāva or
[GITA:9933] innate nature).
[GITA:9934]  Karma (Fruitive Action) refers to visarga, the special activity of
[GITA:9935] creating the universe performed by the Lord Almighty.

[GITA:9951] O Arjuna! The five b asic elements of material nature (earth, fire,
[GITA:9952] water, space, and wind) form Adhibhoota. Superior deities who reside
[GITA:9953] inside and govern the physical bodies of living beings (namely Sesha, the
[GITA:9954] serpent deity, and the four faced deity Brahma) form Adhidaiva. Powering
[GITA:9955] all living bein gs and the consumer of offerings in all sacrifices is I, going
[GITA:9956] by the name of Adhiyajna (Lord of Sacrifice). (8.4)
[GITA:9958] Comments: The Lord continues to answer Arjuna’s remaining questions:
[GITA:9960]  Adhibhoota (Prime Nature) refers to the five basic elements of
[GITA:9961] nature, (fire, water, earth, space, and wind) that comprise one ’s
[GITA:9962] physical body.
[GITA:9963]  Adhidaiva (prime deities) refers to superior deities such as Sesha and
[GITA:9964] four-faced Brahma that reside in the bodies of living beings.
[GITA:9965]  Adhiyajna (Lord of Sacrifice) refers to Me (Lord Krishna).
[GITA:9966]  The Lord is termed Adhiyajna as He activates and po wers one to
[GITA:9967] perform sacrifices , and He is also the consumer of the essence of
[GITA:9968] such sacrifices, as was stated previously (verse 5.29).
[GITA:9970] Sri Rayaru in GV  provides additional interpretations for some of these
[GITA:9971] entities based on Sri Madhwacharya’s GB as follows: Adhyatma also refers
[GITA:9972] to the Lord’s form (as He has the prime or supreme form), Adhidaiva also
[GITA:9973] refers to Goddess Mahalakshmi (as she is the foremost among all deities),
[GITA:9974] and Adhibhoota refers to all living beings (as living beings are superior to
[GITA:9975] inert objects).

[GITA:9998] One who thinks of Me (Kris hna) at the time of leavin g one’s body
[GITA:9999] will attain Me. There is no doubt about this. (8.5)
[GITA:10001] O son of Kunti! Whatever entity one think s of at the time of leaving
[GITA:10002] one’s body, one will attain the same entity (due to the force of habit). (8.6)
[GITA:10004] Comments: The Lord answers Arjuna’s eight h question by stating
[GITA:10005] that learned seekers remember the Lord at the time of leaving  the body
[GITA:10006] which results in their  attaining the Lord, which is a state of permanent,
[GITA:10007] exalted happiness dev oid of any misery. How does one  who is focused on
[GITA:10008] the Lord at t he ti me of departing this world  reach the Lord? Whatever
[GITA:10009] entity one is thinking of during the last moments, the person will attain that
[GITA:10010] entity in the succeeding births. The story of King Bharata in the Bhagavata
[GITA:10011] Purana illustrates this. Bharata once rescued a d eer strugg ling in flood
[GITA:10012] waters and nursed it back to health. He developed a strong attachment to it
[GITA:10013] and was thinking of it even at the last moments of his life. This resulted in
[GITA:10014] him being born as a deer.
[GITA:10016] It should be noted that the verse says, anta kala , meaning the final
[GITA:10017] moments. It does not say the  final instant. This is because  everyone, at the
[GITA:10018] exact final instant of the soul leaving the body , feels relief. However, it is
[GITA:10019] only the learned  devotees of the Lord who  remember Him in the moments
[GITA:10020] leading up to death.
[GITA:10022] Sri Madhwacharya in his Bhagavata Tatparya Nirnaya  [BTN]
[GITA:10023] commentary on the epic Bhagavata Maha Purana  [BMP] (10.1.42)
[GITA:10024] quotes the Naradeeya Purana  and states that one ’s innate eligibility and
[GITA:10025] the Lord’s will are the deci ding factors in determinin g one’s next birth (in
[GITA:10026] addition to ones final thoughts). Thus, one who is thinking of angels during
[GITA:10027] the last moments may not be born as an angel but may be born in the
[GITA:10028] vicinity of angels.

[GITA:10044] Hence keep thinking about Me (Krishna) always. Perform your duty
[GITA:10045] of fighting this just war with your mind and intellect focused on Me and
[GITA:10046] you will certainly attain Me. There is no doubt about this. (8.7)
[GITA:10048] Comments: After emphasizing the need t o remember Him during
[GITA:10049] one’s last moments , the Lord gets back to Arjuna’s dilemma. He exhorts
[GITA:10050] him to keep his mind and intellect focused on Him and get on with fighting
[GITA:10051] the just war. This w ould ensure that Arjuna w ould not be tainted by any
[GITA:10052] adverse effects of the war.

[GITA:10060] Lord’s abode. (8.8)
[GITA:10062] Comments: How can one ensure that one ’s mind will be focused on
[GITA:10063] the Lord during the final moments, especially as one would normally be in
[GITA:10064] great pain due to physical ailments? The Lord answer s by stating that
[GITA:10065] through rigorous practice of mind control, one can develop the habit of
[GITA:10066] focusing the mind on Him and approach all activities with the attitude that
[GITA:10067] He is the one who is performing the activities. This will help a seeker keep
[GITA:10068] the Lord in mind, which becomes useful during the last moments of life.

[GITA:10089] One should  meditate on the  Lord Almighty as one who is

[GITA:10092] everything in the universe, who is incomprehensible, who has the radiance
[GITA:10093] of the sun, and who transcends  material nature . One should think of the
[GITA:10094] Lord, especially during one’s last moments. (8.9)
[GITA:10096] Comments: The previous verses stated that one must remember the
[GITA:10097] Lord during one’s final moments. In what way should one remember the
[GITA:10098] Lord? This verse provides a compact yet powerf ul description of the Lord’s
[GITA:10099] form and attributes as eight  qualities that one must memoris e and make
[GITA:10100] efforts to remember always. This would make it easy for a seeker to
[GITA:10101] remember the Lord during the final moments. The comparison of the
[GITA:10102] Lord’s radiance with that of the sun is only to give an example so that one
[GITA:10103] can comprehend  it to some extent. The Lord’s qualities , such as radiance
[GITA:10104] and splendor, are infinite. Just to ensure that there is no misinterpretation
[GITA:10105] due to the comparison with the sun, this verse also  uses the phrase tamasa
[GITA:10106] para meaning the Lord transcends material nature.

[GITA:10120] Rayaru in GV clarifies that this requirement applies primarily to those who

[GITA:10135] must practis e other techniques indicated earlier , such as detachment,
[GITA:10136] devotion, learning etc., to achieve moksha. Sri Jaya  Teertha in PD  states
[GITA:10137] that two types of seekers are recognis ed here. One who is proficient in t he

[GITA:10185] Comments: As there are many channels in the body, one must
[GITA:10186] attempt to leave the body out of the head through the Sushumna channel to
[GITA:10187] reach the Lord’s a bode. One who leaves the body through other channels
[GITA:10188] will reach other worlds. For example, one leaving out of one’s eye will
[GITA:10189] reach Surya Loka, the world of the Sun deity. This verse also states that the
[GITA:10190] seeker should focus  the mind on hrudi, which Sri Raya ru GV clarifies in a
[GITA:10191] reference to Lord Narayana . The word hrudi expands as harati + jagat ,
[GITA:10192] meaning ‘One who dissolves the universe’.
[GITA:10194] The primordial syllable Om succinctly represents the Lord. Om made
[GITA:10195] up of three letters a, u, and ma, expands into the thre e parts of the holy
[GITA:10196] Gayatri hymn , which itself expands into the three sections of  the Vedic
[GITA:10197] hymn, the Purusha Sookta, from which all Vedic literature emerged. Later
[GITA:10198] in chapter 10.25, the Lord Himself states that among all letters, He dwells
[GITA:10199] in the letter Om giving it supremacy. Verse 17.23 also has additional details
[GITA:10200] on the primordial syllable Om.

[GITA:10209] Comments: In the previous verses , the Lord instructed that one
[GITA:10210] should strive to remember Him during one’s final moments. In this verse, it
[GITA:10211] is clarified that only those who are constan tly thinking about, meditating on
[GITA:10212] the Lord ( nitya yukta) and forcibly withdrawing the wandering mind from
[GITA:10213] worldly issues, will be able to remember Him when it counts the most, that
[GITA:10214] is, at the final moment.

[GITA:10242] O Arjuna! Those who  hereafter attain all other heavenly worlds
[GITA:10243] below the abode of Brahma will ultimately return to the  cycle of births and
[GITA:10244] deaths. O son of Kunti! Those who attain My abode will be in eternal bliss
[GITA:10245] and will never be born again. (8.16)
[GITA:10247] Comments: In ver se 8.13 , it is stated that the learned ones who
[GITA:10248] remember the Lord during their final moments will reach the Lord’s abode.
[GITA:10249] These two verses clarify that one who reaches the Lord’s abode will not
[GITA:10250] return to the earth , which is the dwelling place for living beings with
[GITA:10251] transitory physical bodies.
[GITA:10253] The six upper worlds above eart h are Bhuvarloka, Suvarloka,
[GITA:10254] Maharloka, Janoloka, Tapoloka and Satyaloka . Those who reach the
[GITA:10255] worlds of Janoloka, Tapoloka, and Satyaloka will not return to earth. This
[GITA:10256] is because of the Lord’s special presence in them. This is clarified by Sri
[GITA:10257] Rayaru in [GV].
[GITA:10272] Chapter 8                                                                                                                                          215

[GITA:10283] Comments: In this verse, the Lord introduces the concept of day and
[GITA:10284] night in relation to His acts of creation and dissolution of the universe. Sri
[GITA:10285] Rayaru in GV states that the word sahasra used in this verse should not be
[GITA:10286] construed to literally mean thousands, but to uncountable multitudes (as no
[GITA:10287] one can count the Lord’s time). The duration of creation and dissolution of
[GITA:10288] the universe  are symbolically indicated as daytime and night-time for the
[GITA:10289] Lord Almighty, as His time cannot be measured.
[GITA:10291] Sri Satyadhyana Teertha in his GPC states that the yuga referred here
[GITA:10292] indicates one hundred years of deity Brahma, whose one year is made up of
[GITA:10293] 360 days, with each day equating to 864 crore (8.64 billion) human years.

[GITA:10298] During the Lord Almighty’s daytime (after the conclusion of the

[GITA:10301] dissolved into Him. (8.18)
[GITA:10303] Comments: The dawn of the day for the Lord (avyakta) is when the
[GITA:10304] dissolution of the universe is complete  and the process of creation starts.
[GITA:10305] The time of dissolution of the universe is described as the “nighttime of the
[GITA:10306] Lord”. No one can measure the Lo rd’s time. Sri Madhwacharya in GTN
[GITA:10307] states that the word nimesha (time to bat an eyelid) is used to informally
[GITA:10319] 216                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita

[GITA:10347] This unmanifest principle is the Lord Almighty, to reach whom, is
[GITA:10348] the goal of everyone. One who reaches Him will never return to this world.
[GITA:10349] Such is My supreme form. (8.21)
[GITA:10351] Comments: Since the previous verses described the concepts of day
[GITA:10352] and night for the Lord to represent the times of creation and dissolution of
[GITA:10353] the universe, one may question if the Lord is also subject to birth and

[GITA:10368] and dissolution , is eternal, has no beginning or end , and is imperishable.
[GITA:10369] Verse 8.21  clarifies that He goes by the name of Akshara (one without
[GITA:10370] decay), because of His imperishable nature . This verse also states that one
[GITA:10371] who reaches the Lord’s abode will never return to the earth.
[GITA:10373] Verse 8.20  uses the terms para and anya meaning supreme and
[GITA:10374] different, respectively, indicating that the Lord Almighty is superior to and
[GITA:10375] different from all other entities i n the universe, such as individual souls and
[GITA:10376] inert objects. This concept i s further emphasised later in C hapter 15 (verses

[GITA:10418] O Arjuna, superior among the Bharatas! I will now teach you about
[GITA:10419] the paths taken by seekers , from which they will either return to this world
[GITA:10420] or not return to this world. The paths are identifie d by the ir respective
[GITA:10421] governing deities. (8.23)
[GITA:10423] Eligible seekers, leaving this world through the path s of deities
[GITA:10424] governing fire, light, daytime, the fortnight of  the waxing moon, and the
[GITA:10425] first half of a lunar year, will reach the abode of the Lord and not return to
[GITA:10426] this world. (8.24)
[GITA:10428] Other seekers leaving this world through the path of deities
[GITA:10429] governing smoke, nighttime, the fortnight of the waning moon, and  the
[GITA:10430] second half of a lunar year will reach the land of the Moon deity and will
[GITA:10431] return to this world again. (8.25)
[GITA:10433] These two paths are permanent and are termed the Shukla path and
[GITA:10434] the Krishna path. Those leaving through the first path will not return , and
[GITA:10435] those leaving through the second path will return to this world. (8.26)
[GITA:10437] Comments: These three v erses describe the paths taken by a soul
[GITA:10438] after leaving the physical body. The soul progressively traverse s the worlds
[GITA:10439] governed by various deities. Some seekers leave this world and traverse the
[GITA:10440] worlds governed by the following deities : Agni/Archi (fire), Aha (daytime),
[GITA:10441] Shukla Paksha (fortnight of waxing moon), and uttarayana (first half of a
[GITA:10442] lunar new year). These seekers , who predominantly take the path of
[GITA:10443] knowledge ( jnana yogis ), will ultimately reach the abode of the Lord
[GITA:10444] Almighty and never return to the  earth. Other seekers leave this world and
[GITA:10445] traverse the worlds gov erned by the following deities:  dhooma (smoke),
[GITA:10457] Chapter 8                                                                                                                                          219
[GITA:10459] ratri (nighttime), krishna paksha  (fortnight of the waning moon) and
[GITA:10460] dakshinayana (second half of a lunar new year). These seekers, who are
[GITA:10461] focused on the path of action (karma yogis) with the expectation of rewards
[GITA:10462] will return to this earth.
[GITA:10464] Some commentators adopt the literal translation of the times and
[GITA:10465] periods indicated in these verses and wrongly conclude that the destination
[GITA:10466] of a soul dep ends on the time, day, fortnight, and month of lea ving this
[GITA:10467] world. Sri Rayaru in GV, based on Sri Madhwacharya’s GB,  clarifies that
[GITA:10468] the reference to the time periods indicated in these verses should be
[GITA:10469] interpreted to mean the respective governing deities. After all, time is inert.
[GITA:10470] How can time determine the destination of a soul? Also, not all entities
[GITA:10471] identified in these verses are related to time ( kala). For example,
[GITA:10472] agni/archi, and dhooma are not related to time. Hence , the entities
[GITA:10473] described in these ve rses can only be interpreted to mean their respective
[GITA:10474] governing deities. Furt her, as per Sri Madhwacharya’s GB , in the Padma
[GITA:10475] Purana it is clarified that an aparoksha jnani (a seeker with direct, divine
[GITA:10476] knowledge of the Lord) will achieve li beration regardless of the time, day,
[GITA:10477] fortnight, month of leaving this world.
[GITA:10479] In the Mahabharata, it i s stated that Bheeshma waited  until the
[GITA:10480] onset of uttarayana (the first half of the lunar year) to leave this world.
[GITA:10481] Does this not imply the superiority of one period ove r the other? It is
[GITA:10482] clarified by Sri Jaya  Teertha in [ND] that among those who attain
[GITA:10483] liberation, the ones who leave their body during the period of uttarayana
[GITA:10484] experience higher bliss. One must remember that Bheeshma was an iccha
[GITA:10485] marani and had the power to decide the time of his exit from th e world. His
[GITA:10486] situation cannot be generalized.
[GITA:10488] In summary, a soul’s destination after leaving t he physical body is
[GITA:10489] based on its efforts and performance during its  soul’s lifetime in this world
[GITA:10490] and the acquisition of divi ne, spiritual knowledge , including knowledge
[GITA:10491] about the paths taken hereafter. The destination is not determined by the
[GITA:10503] 220                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:10504] time of the soul leaving the body. Sri  Rayaru also clarifies this in GV,
[GITA:10505] quoting the Brahma Sutra (4.2.22).

[GITA:10517] the prescribed activities to reach the Lord. (8.27)
[GITA:10519] One who understands these principles will accrue more benefits
[GITA:10520] compared to accru als from studying the Vedas, performing sacrifices, and
[GITA:10521] donating to others. Moreover, such a seeker will indeed reach the Lord’s
[GITA:10522] abode. (8.28)
[GITA:10524] Comments: These two verses conclude the teachings in this chapter.
[GITA:10525] Lord Krishna instructs Arjuna to understand thoroughly the process of a
[GITA:10526] soul leaving the physical body and the paths taken in reaching the ultimate
[GITA:10527] destination. The Lord reiterates that Arjuna must perform his prescribed
[GITA:10528] duty of waging the just war with proper conviction in the concepts
[GITA:10529] described in this chapter. Further, such knowledge about the paths taken by
[GITA:10530] a soul result s in one earn ing much more benefit than that  available from
[GITA:10531] other spiritual activities such as learning the Vedas, donating to charity ,
[GITA:10532] etc. The intent here is to demonstrate the importance of such knowledge.
[GITA:10534] Summary of Chapter 8
[GITA:10536] Chapter 7 covered the issues of knowledge and wisdom as they relate
[GITA:10537] to the Lord. Towards the end of that chapter, in verses 7.29 and 7.30 , the
[GITA:10549] Chapter 8                                                                                                                                          221
[GITA:10551] Lord introduced some special topics such as Adhibhoota, Adhid aiva,
[GITA:10552] Adhiyajna, etc. This terminology was used for the first time , and Arjuna
[GITA:10553] naturally had questions about their  context and meaning. The Lord answers
[GITA:10554] Arjuna’s questions, and much of the chapter is devoted to the act of
[GITA:10555] remembering the Lord dur ing one’s final moments and one ’s journey
[GITA:10556] hereafter. Arjuna asks eight questions in verses 8.1 and 8.2  and the Lord
[GITA:10557] answers them in verses 8.3 - 8.5. Brahma refers to the imperishable Lord.
[GITA:10558] Adhyatma refers to material equipment  that allow s a soul to act (body,
[GITA:10559] sense organs, conscience). Karma refers to the Lord’s act of creation ,
[GITA:10560] which is responsible for the birth and existence of all living beings. Basic
[GITA:10561] elements of material nature such as earth and fire form  ‘Adhibhoota’.
[GITA:10562] Superior deities who reside inside and gove rn the physical bodies of living
[GITA:10563] beings (namely Sesha, the serpent deity , and the four -faced deity Brahma)
[GITA:10564] form Adhidaiva. Powering all living beings and the consumer of offerings
[GITA:10565] in all sacrifices is the Lord, going by the name of  Adhiyajna (Lord of
[GITA:10566] Sacrifice). The Lord answers Arjuna’s eighth question by stating that
[GITA:10567] learned seekers remember the Lord at the time of leaving their bodies,
[GITA:10568] which results in their  attaining Him. In verses 8.6  - 8.14, the Lord teaches
[GITA:10569] the need for one to remember Him during the  final moments and the
[GITA:10570] procedure to do the same. Verses 8.15 - 8.16 state that those who remember
[GITA:10571] the Lord properly during their final moments will not return to earth. The
[GITA:10572] concept of the Lord Almighty’s day and night and their relationship to His
[GITA:10573] acts of creation and dissolution of the universe are addressed in verses
[GITA:10574] 8.17-8.20. The Lord declares in verse 8.22 that the path of devotion is
[GITA:10575] supreme among all paths available to reach the Lord. The paths taken by a
[GITA:10576] soul after leaving the physical body are described in verses 8.23 - 8.26. The
[GITA:10577] chapter is concluded in verses 8.27 and  8.28 with the Lord instructing
[GITA:10578] Arjuna to focus on his prescribed duty of waging the just war while being
[GITA:10579] fully aware of the key concepts covered in this chapter . These include the
[GITA:10580] knowledge of paths traversed by a soul after leaving the physical body ,
[GITA:10581] with the ultimate destination being the Lord’s abode.

[GITA:10599] Chapter 9 – Path of Supreme Knowledge and Secrets
[GITA:10601] Chapter Introduction: This chapter, titled the ‘Path of Supreme
[GITA:10602] Knowledge and Secrets’ comprises 34 verses. The central message here is
[GITA:10603] an assurance to all seekers that they will have their desires fulfilled through
[GITA:10604] devoted worship and meditation on the Lord. Th e wise seek the Lord
[GITA:10605] through such devotion and worship, while the ignorant seek limited
[GITA:10606] material and mundane gains , and never lead a fulfilled life. This chapter is
[GITA:10607] a continuation of the concepts in Chapter 7 where some important attributes
[GITA:10608] of the Lord wer e revealed. Towards the end of Chapter 7, the Lord
[GITA:10609] introduces some new concepts such as Adhyatma, Adhibhoota, Adhidaiva,
[GITA:10610] Adhiyajna etc. Arjuna’s questions about these concepts were answered in
[GITA:10611] Chapter 8. Now, the Lord continues the discussion from Chapter 7. In that
[GITA:10612] sense, Chapters 7, 8 and 9 are in proper sequence. While the Lord has
[GITA:10613] infinite auspicious forms, attributes, activities etc., there are eight activities
[GITA:10614] of the Lord Almighty that directly impact living beings. They are – creation
[GITA:10615] (Srishti), sust enance ( Stithi), dissolution ( laya), regulation ( niyamana),
[GITA:10616] knowledge ( jnana), ignorance ( ajnana), bondage ( bandha) and liberation
[GITA:10617] (moksha). Together they are called Janmadi ashtaka  and they are also
[GITA:10618] covered in this chapter. This chapter is called  the Path  of Supreme
[GITA:10619] Knowledge (‘Raja Vidya Yoga ’) as it teaches these particularly important
[GITA:10620] concepts about the Lord. It is also called  the Path of supreme secrets (‘Raja
[GITA:10621] Guhya Yoga’) meant only for the faithful.

[GITA:10649] The Lord said: I will now impart most confidential principles to you,
[GITA:10650] as you are devoid of faults such as envy and are eligible to receive this
[GITA:10651] teaching. Gaining this sacred and special knowledge along with knowledge
[GITA:10652] from the scriptures will free you from evil. (9.1)
[GITA:10654] It is the cro wn of knowledge. It is the pinnacle of secrets. It is
[GITA:10655] purifying. It is superior. It is the means to learn about the Lord Almighty
[GITA:10656] who powers everyone’s sense organs. It is easy to follow, and it is the path
[GITA:10657] for eternal bliss. (9.2)
[GITA:10659] O Parantapa! Those who do not have faith in the knowledge that
[GITA:10660] teaches about the Lord Almighty will not reach the Lord and will keep
[GITA:10661] returning to this mortal worldly life. (9.3)
[GITA:10663] Comments: The Lord starts His sermon by stating that He will be
[GITA:10664] teaching particularly, important and very confidential concepts here. This is
[GITA:10665] to draw the attention of seekers and to generate curiosity in them. Only
[GITA:10666] those who are pure and are devoid of negative attributes such as envy are
[GITA:10667] eligible and able to understand these teachings. The Lord resolves to teach
[GITA:10668] Arjuna both general knowledge that would be available from scriptures
[GITA:10669] (jnana) and special, divine knowledge ( vijnana) which is not easily
[GITA:10670] available. Only those who are sincere in their devotion to the Lord can
[GITA:10671] imbibe such special knowledge, hence it is most secretive.
[GITA:10673] The Lord imparts this knowledge over the nex t 16 verses. In 12
[GITA:10674] verses from 9.4 – 9.15, general knowledge ( jnana) that would be available
[GITA:10675] from scriptures is taught. The next 4 verses 9.16 – 9.19, contain discussion
[GITA:10676] on special, divine knowledge (vijnana).

[GITA:10700] Everything in this universe is pervaded by My unmanifest form
[GITA:10701] which cannot be seen. All inert objects and sentient beings are supported by
[GITA:10702] Me. But I am not dependent on anyone for support. (9.4)
[GITA:10704] Everything in the universe, including sentient beings and inert
[GITA:10705] objects, even though  anchored in Me (Krishna), cannot perceive Me
[GITA:10706] through sense organs . Look at My infinit e, divine powers . Even though
[GITA:10707] they are anchored in Me, I do not depend on them. (9.5)
[GITA:10709] The majestic wind blowing in space is not impacted by the attributes
[GITA:10710] of entities that it encounters. Similarly, even though every living being is
[GITA:10711] anchored in Me, there is no mutual superimposition of attributes. (9.6)
[GITA:10713] Comments: These three verses provide details  on the concept of the
[GITA:10714] Lord’s manifestation in every object in the universe; inert and sentient. The
[GITA:10715] Lord is omnipresent and is the supporter for everything in the universe but
[GITA:10716] Himself needs no support of anyone or anything. If the Lord is pervading
[GITA:10717] everywhere, why is He not seen? Verse 9.4  defines the Lord’s attribute of
[GITA:10718] avyakta (the unmanifest), because of which He is not seen.
[GITA:10720] Anyone standing on the ground experiences the condition of the
[GITA:10721] ground. For example, if the ground is cool or hot due to  the weather, one
[GITA:10733] Chapter 9                                                                                                                                        225
[GITA:10735] standing on it will feel the cold or the heat. This is due to the impact of
[GITA:10736] contact between the object that is supported and the object that is providing
[GITA:10737] the support. So, if the Lord is supporting everything in the universe, why is
[GITA:10738] that support not felt physically by the beings in the unive rse? This is
[GITA:10739] answered in verse 9.5, where it is stated that those who are supported by the
[GITA:10740] Lord cannot perceive Him through their sense organs. This is
[GITA:10741] fundamentally because (unlike the example of the ground ), t he Lord does
[GITA:10742] not have a physical form made up of material nature but has a
[GITA:10743] transcendental form.
[GITA:10745] It must be noted  in verse 9.5,  the Lord uses the term ‘ mama atma ’
[GITA:10746] (my soul) as the entity that pervades and supports everything in t he
[GITA:10747] universe. However, in v erse 9.4, the Lord uses the term ‘ avyakta moorthy’
[GITA:10748] (unmanifest form) as the entity that pervades and supports everything in the
[GITA:10749] universe. How can these be reconciled? Sri Jaya  Teertha in PD  explains
[GITA:10750] that the reason for using different terminology is to con firm that, in the case
[GITA:10751] of the Lord, His form and soul are the same. This is quite different from the
[GITA:10752] case of living beings where the physical form and the soul are different.
[GITA:10754] The concept in verse 9.5 is illustrated through the examp le of a
[GITA:10755] gentle breeze i n verse 9.6 . A gentle, majestic wind blowing in space
[GITA:10756] encounters many objects in its path but does not assume the attributes of
[GITA:10757] those objects. Likewise, even though the Lord pervades everything in the
[GITA:10758] universe and supports everyone in the universe, His att ributes do not get
[GITA:10759] contaminated by entities He encounters. They too  cannot imbibe His
[GITA:10760] attributes onto themselves. Some can question the appropriateness of using
[GITA:10761] the wind as an example. When a gently blowing wind is in the vicinity of a
[GITA:10762] fragrant object (say a flower), one who is nearby can smell the fragrance of
[GITA:10763] the flower carried by the wind. How can one say that the wind is not
[GITA:10764] contaminated b y the fragrance? Sri Rayaru in GV  answers by stating that
[GITA:10765] fragrance does not itself become a quality of the wind. The wind stays
[GITA:10766] independent of the fragrance. The particles that constitute fragrance are
[GITA:10767] carried by the wind but do not become an attribute of the wind. Once the
[GITA:10768] wind travels a sufficient distance, the fragrance is no longer present as
[GITA:10780] 226                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:10781] those particles are di ssipated. This proves that  the wind itself does not take
[GITA:10782] on the attribute of the fragrance. Hence, the example of the wind is
[GITA:10783] appropriate.
[GITA:10785] These verses describe the attribute of Stithi (sustenance) among the
[GITA:10786] eight major attributes of the Lord referred to in the introduction to this
[GITA:10787] chapter.

[GITA:10794] O Son of Kunti! During the grand dissolution of the universe, all
[GITA:10795] sentient and non -sentient entities will merge with the triumvirate of nature
[GITA:10796] (sattva, rajas and tamas attributes) which are under My control. At the start
[GITA:10797] of the next cycle, I will recreate the entities (give them physical forms).
[GITA:10798] (9.7)
[GITA:10799] Comments: After dis cussing His attributes of omnipresence and
[GITA:10800] pervasiveness in verses 9.4 – 9.6, the Lord describes His role in the process
[GITA:10801] of creation ( Srishti) and dissolution ( laya) of the universe  in the next few
[GITA:10802] verses .
[GITA:10804] The Lord uses the term ‘visrujami’ to describe His act of creation of
[GITA:10805] the universe, instead of the usual term ‘srujami’. Sri Rayaru clarifies in GV
[GITA:10806] that ‘visrujami’ refers to special creation while srujami refers to normal
[GITA:10807] creation. This is to indicate the fact that the souls of living beings are
[GITA:10808] eternal and are not subject to creation, and during the time of creation, the
[GITA:10809] Lord gives physical bodies to different souls in different species , based on
[GITA:10810] the nature of those souls.

[GITA:10828] The triumvirate of nature is always under My control. Using them as
[GITA:10829] the material cause, I keep creating multitudes of entities (sentient and inert)
[GITA:10830] again and again. (9.8)
[GITA:10832] Comments: The previous verse stated the Lord’s activities of
[GITA:10833] creation and dissolution of the universe. In this verse, the Lord states the
[GITA:10834] procedure that He uses for creation. The Lord utilizes the inert nature
[GITA:10835] which is under His control as the material cau se for creation. Sri Rayaru in
[GITA:10836] GV clarifies that the Lord does not need an y entity or utility to perform
[GITA:10837] activities, but He uses inert nature for creation out of His free will.

[GITA:10842] O Dhananjaya! These activities such as creation of the universe can
[GITA:10843] never bind Me. Even though I perform these activities, it is as if I never
[GITA:10844] performed them because of My detachment. (9.9)
[GITA:10846] Comments: Anyone performing any activity naturally must face
[GITA:10847] consequences for such activity. Is the Lord also bound by His activities
[GITA:10848] such as creation which results in multitudes of entities being born? This
[GITA:10849] verse answers by stating that the Lord is not bound by His actions. There
[GITA:10850] are two reasons for this . One, the Lord does not perform these actions for
[GITA:10851] any gain but rather to help the i ndividual souls on their spiritual journey .
[GITA:10852] Secondly, the Lord Himself controls all activities ( karma). Therefore,
[GITA:10853] karma can never bind the Lord.
[GITA:10855] Sri Madhwacharya in GB  explains the context for the use of the
[GITA:10856] word udaaseena (meaning indifference) when it  comes to the Lord’s
[GITA:10857] attitude in performing actions such as creation. It is known that one needs
[GITA:10858] the Lord’s grace to receive any benefits from Him . Given this, the Lord
[GITA:10859] must have some interest in such activities. How can He then be indifferent?
[GITA:10860] We can unde rstand this when we see that t he word ‘indifferent’ refers to
[GITA:10872] 228                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:10873] the Lord’s effortless, unattached approach to His activities as He has
[GITA:10874] nothing to gain from them.

[GITA:10879] O Son of Kunti ! Under My supervision, Mother Nature creates the
[GITA:10880] universe made up of sentient and inert objects. Through the mother nature,
[GITA:10881] the universe undergoes the cycle of repeated creation. (9.10)
[GITA:10883] Comments: If the Lord indeed shows indifference in the process of
[GITA:10884] creation of the Universe , as stated in the previous verse, does it mean that
[GITA:10885] the Lord has no interest in or oversight over this activity? This verse
[GITA:10886] counters this question by stating that the process of creation and indeed all
[GITA:10887] His activities occur under His supervision, which is implied by the use of
[GITA:10888] the word adhyaksha. Sri Rayaru explains in GV  that adhyaksha means one
[GITA:10889] who is overseeing or supervising the activity , as aksha means seeing. The
[GITA:10890] process of creation is performed by sentient Mother Nature (Sri Lak shmi)
[GITA:10891] using inert nature , under the supervision and control of the Lord. In
[GITA:10892] summary, while the Lord performs creation using  sentient and insentient
[GITA:10893] nature without effort or attachment, He supervis es and oversee s the
[GITA:10894] process. This verse describes the attrib ute of Niyamana (regulation) among
[GITA:10895] the eight major attributes of the Lord referred to in the introduction to this
[GITA:10896] chapter, as the Lord is seen to be supervising and overseeing the process of
[GITA:10897] creation.

[GITA:10919] Ignorant fools are unaware that I (Krishna) am the Supreme being,
[GITA:10920] eternal and full of infinite, auspicious attributes. They insult Me by
[GITA:10921] considering Me as having a human like body (subject to decay and death).
[GITA:10922] (9.11)
[GITA:10924] Those with demoniac natures have their intellect clouded with
[GITA:10925] ignorance. Their desires  for heaven will not be realized. Thei r rituals and
[GITA:10926] sacrifices are a wasted effort. They will not attain true spiritual knowledge
[GITA:10927] and they are senseless. (9.12)
[GITA:10929] Comments: while the Lord, who has infinite powers is responsible
[GITA:10930] for the creation, sustenance, and dissolution of the universe and f or
[GITA:10931] granting physical bodies to all souls, why is it that some consider Him the
[GITA:10932] same as other human beings? And why are there no consequences for those
[GITA:10933] who are insulting the ever-compassionate Lord? These two verses provide
[GITA:10934] the answers. Ignorant ones look a t the Lord’s incarnations such as Rama,
[GITA:10935] Vamana, Krishna etc., and assume that the Lord too has a human like body.
[GITA:10936] They are not able to comprehend the Lord’s infinite attributes and strength.
[GITA:10937] The reason for their ignorance is their innate nature , which the Lord
[GITA:10938] describes using the word ‘ prakrutim’ (by nature). Some even have hatred
[GITA:10939] towards the Lord. Such demoniac people will not achieve any lasting
[GITA:10940] rewards or spiritual knowledge , and hence will not be able to perform any
[GITA:10941] activity that would lead to liberation.
[GITA:10943] In the epic [BMP] Bhagavata Maha Purana (7th canto, 7 -1-32),
[GITA:10944] there is a discussion on Shishupala  (the king of Chedi  and a known
[GITA:10945] adversary of Krishna ) who hurled many abuses at the Lord  and was killed
[GITA:10946] by Him. As per BMP, ultimately Shishupala achieves moksha. Some
[GITA:10947] interpret this to mean that even those who constantly hate the Lord are
[GITA:10948] thinking about Him incessantly and hence are eligible for moksha. It is
[GITA:10949] clarified in Sri Madhwacha rya’s [MBTN] verse 21 -259, and BTN  verse
[GITA:10950] 7-1-32, that Shishupala had two separate souls resident in his body. One
[GITA:10951] was the pious soul of Jaya (one of the doorkeepers of the Lord’s abode) and
[GITA:10952] the other was that of a demon. Due to a curse, Jaya had to endure being in
[GITA:10964] 230                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:10965] Shishupala’s body. When Shishupala was killed by Lord Krishna, Jaya
[GITA:10966] attained the Lord, while the demoniac soul was relegated to the eternal hell.

[GITA:10977] Comments: If some view the Lord as human -like (as stated in verse
[GITA:10978] 9.11), could that be due to the Lord having human like attributes? This
[GITA:10979] verse answers that question by stating that if that were so, even those with
[GITA:10980] divine nature should consider the Lord as human like. But that is not the
[GITA:10981] case. Those with divine nature know the Lord as being responsible for the
[GITA:10982] existence of all entities in the universe and  that He Himself is not subject to
[GITA:10983] decay. They worship the Lord single mindedly. Sri Rayaru  in GV explains
[GITA:10984] that the Lord is not subject to fourfold decay – (i) in the physical body
[GITA:10985] (as He has a transcendental body), (ii) in the soul (as no soul is subject  to
[GITA:10986] decay), (iii) in attributes (as the Lord is full of infinite auspicious attributes)
[GITA:10987] and (iv) in happiness (as He is always devoid of misery). The concept of
[GITA:10988] fourfold decay was explained in verse 2.18 . This verse describes true
[GITA:10989] knowledge (jnana) that is characteristic of pious souls.

[GITA:11010] Such pious souls worship Me (Krishna) in various ways – through
[GITA:11011] constant singing of My glories, through involvement in strict rituals such as
[GITA:11012] fasting, through constant meditation and through constant salutations to
[GITA:11013] Me. They strive hard to achieve spiritual knowledge and worship Me with
[GITA:11014] great devotion. (9.14)
[GITA:11016] Some seekers worship Me through the sacrifice of knowledge
[GITA:11017] (listening, analyzing, and contemplating on spiritual knowledge). Some
[GITA:11018] worship My primary form (Narayana), or My various forms (Vasudeva ,
[GITA:11019] etc.) knowing that all these forms are identical and that I am omnipresent,
[GITA:11020] with infinite forms. (9.15)
[GITA:11022] Comments: In verse 9.13 , it was stated that pious souls worship the
[GITA:11023] Lord with the knowledge that He has a never -ending existence. In these
[GITA:11024] two verses, the path of worship is described. Some worship the primary
[GITA:11025] form of the Lord as Narayana, others worship the various forms that
[GITA:11026] originated from Narayana such as the four forms of Aniruddha, Pradyumna,
[GITA:11027] Sankarshana, Vasudeva and the twenty-four forms that start from Keshava
[GITA:11028] (multifaceted worship). The Lord is same in  all His forms. Further, the
[GITA:11029] Lord is different from other entities such as individual souls and inert
[GITA:11030] objects as indicated using the word prithak meaning different. Sri Rayaru in
[GITA:11031] GV indicates another interpretation of the multifaceted worship of the
[GITA:11032] Lord,  and the different types of sacrifices performed by seekers , which was
[GITA:11033] stated previously in chapter 4 (4.25).

[GITA:11053] I am the action of sacrifice. I am the ritual of sacrifice. I am the
[GITA:11054] offering to departed elders. I am the healing herb. I am the hymn. I am ghee
[GITA:11055] offered in sacrifice. I am the ritual fire. I am the offering. (9.16)
[GITA:11057] I am the father, mother , supporter, worshipful grandfather of this
[GITA:11058] universe. I am the subject of all knowledge and everything that is holy. I
[GITA:11059] am postulated by the primordial holy syllable ‘ Om’ and the infinite
[GITA:11060] Vedas - Rik, Sama and Yajur (9.17)
[GITA:11062] Comments: In verse 9.1, the Lord resolves to impart to Arjuna both
[GITA:11063] general knowledge – jnana (obtainable through scriptures) and very,
[GITA:11064] special knowledge (vijnana) about the Lord Almighty. The Lord described
[GITA:11065] such gener al knowledge in 12 verses from 9.4 to 9.15. In the next four
[GITA:11066] verses 9.16 to 9.19 , the Lord teaches special, divine knowledge ( vijnana)
[GITA:11067] which identifies the Lord’s presence in all entities, all activities, all sounds
[GITA:11068] and indeed in everything.
[GITA:11070] In verse 9.16 , the Lord states His presence in all activities and
[GITA:11071] entities that pert ain to a seeker performing a fire ritual to please Him. By
[GITA:11072] stating that He was the ritual of sacrifice, the Lord is indicating that He
[GITA:11073] controls and stimulates the act of a seeker performing a fire ritual.
[GITA:11075] Sri Rayaru in GV  clarifies that one should not at tach peripheral
[GITA:11076] meaning to the activities and entities indicated here, but rather  focus on
[GITA:11077] their hidden, inner, spiritual meaning. With this approach the activities and
[GITA:11078] entities where the Lord indicates His presence and ownership are as
[GITA:11079] follows: father = responsible for one’s birth; mother = responsible for one’s
[GITA:11080] birth; supporter = supports and sustains the universe; grandfather = worthy
[GITA:11081] of worship; knowable = worthy of being known; holy = cause of holiness in
[GITA:11082] holy objects ; symbol Om = full of infinite, aus picious attributes ;
[GITA:11083] rik = worthy of respect ; sama = Equal presence in His various forms ;
[GITA:11084] yajur = worshipped by everyone.

[GITA:11106] friend for everyone. Creation is from Me. Dissolution is from Me. I am the
[GITA:11107] cause for th e existence of everyone and everything. I am the imperishable,
[GITA:11108] primordial seed. (9.18)
[GITA:11110] Comments: In this verse the Lord continues to identify some major
[GITA:11111] activities, entities, and attributes that He is responsible for. In many
[GITA:11112] instances those who achieve l iberation are referred to as having reached the
[GITA:11113] Lord. In this verse, the Lord states that He is indeed the destination for
[GITA:11114] those seeking liberation. The Lord is also known as nidhana, meaning ‘one
[GITA:11115] into whom the universe dissolves’. In verse 9.7, it is stated that the universe
[GITA:11116] dissolves into n ature. Sri Rayaru clarifies in GV , that as nature itself is
[GITA:11117] supported by the Lord, it is appropriate for the Lord to be identified with
[GITA:11118] the act of dissolution. The Lord also uses the qualifier avyayam when
[GITA:11119] referring to the primordial seed, to distinguish the Lord’s nature as being
[GITA:11120] imperishable, in comparison with the seed in the material world that is
[GITA:11121] subject to change and destruction.  Sri Raghuttama Teertha in his PDBB
[GITA:11122] clarifies that the word ‘ nivāsaḥ’ (refuge) here applies to those who are
[GITA:11123] already liberated and those who are seeking liberation.

[GITA:11145] Comments: The Lord identifies His role in gr anting powers to
[GITA:11146] entities, such as heat and light , to the Sun. The Lord is also known as sat
[GITA:11147] and asat. Sri Rayaru explains two different sets of interpretations for these
[GITA:11148] words. Sat and asat mean ‘group of activities’ and ‘the reason for the group
[GITA:11149] of activities’, respectively. Sat also means one who is supreme. The Lord is
[GITA:11150] also known as asat, as this refers to one for whom there is no superior
[GITA:11151] entity. This interpretation is supported by Shabda Nirnaya as indicated by
[GITA:11152] Sri Madhwacharya in GTN.

[GITA:11189] Comments: In the next few verses, the Lord explains the difference
[GITA:11190] in rewards experienced by ritualists (those who perform Vedic rituals with
[GITA:11191] the expectation o f specific outcomes), and His unconditional devotees .
[GITA:11192] Later, verse 9. 24 indicates that the Lord consumes the fruits of all rituals
[GITA:11193] whether they are performed by ritualists or unconditional devotees. If that
[GITA:11194] is so, why is there a difference in the final reward? The difference is due to
[GITA:11195] the approach and attitu de in performing such rituals. Ritualists perform
[GITA:11196] Vedic rituals to propitiate other deities with the expectation of rewards such
[GITA:11197] as worldly riches while on earth, heavenly worlds hereafter etc. They do
[GITA:11198] submit all rituals to the Lord Himself, but their acti vities are not without
[GITA:11199] expectation. On the other hand, unconditional devotees of the Lord perform
[GITA:11200] all activities as an offering to the Lord with utmost devotion and without
[GITA:11201] any expectations. The difference in final rewards is due to the difference in
[GITA:11202] their approach. Previously in verse 7.23 , it was indicated that ritualists only
[GITA:11203] experience temporary fruits. These two verses clarify the meaning of
[GITA:11204] temporary fruits by stating that ritualists do reach the heavenly worlds
[GITA:11205] hereafter, enjoy the privileges there a nd after exhaustion of  credits
[GITA:11206] eventually return to earth (in another birth).

[GITA:11214] already earned. (9.22)
[GITA:11216] Comments: This verse explains the rewards experienced by
[GITA:11217] unconditional devotees of the Lord. They worship the Lord single mindedly
[GITA:11218] without any expectations. The Lord grants them permanent bliss. This is
[GITA:11219] indicated using the phrase ‘ yoga kshema’ where yoga refers to attaining
[GITA:11220] something that one does not yet possess, and kshema refers to the state of
[GITA:11221] retaining what i s attained. Sri Rayaru in GV  explains that yoga here refers
[GITA:11233] 236                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:11234] to attaining liberation (state of bliss) and kshema refers to retaining that
[GITA:11235] state permanently (eternal bliss).
[GITA:11237] This verse is identified as the single verse that represents this entire
[GITA:11238] chapter by  Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha in his BGS, as unconditional
[GITA:11239] devotion to the Lord is the ultimate form of prayer that a seeker needs to

[GITA:11257] and keep going back and forth between t his mundane world and the

[GITA:11261] Those who worship the ancestral deities reach them as well. However,
[GITA:11262] those who worship Me exclusively reach My abode, never to return. (9. 25)
[GITA:11264] Comments: These verses clarify that even for those who only
[GITA:11265] worship other deities, the fruits of their worship are granted by the Lord
[GITA:11266] Himself, as He is the ultimate object and controller of all worships and
[GITA:11278] Chapter 9                                                                                                                                        237
[GITA:11280] sacrifices. Given that the Lord is indeed t he object of all worship, why is
[GITA:11281] there a difference in the rewards for ritualists and unconditional devotees?
[GITA:11282] The difference is due to the approach of these two types of worshippers.
[GITA:11283] What is the reason for the difference in their approach? Verse 9.24 state s
[GITA:11284] that ritualists are not fully aware that the Lord is indeed the object of all
[GITA:11285] worship, which causes them to approach other deities for quick results.
[GITA:11286] Further, verse 9.25 clarifies that ritualists reach the heavenly abodes of the

[GITA:11298] Comments: As the Lord is supreme and is the eventual object of all
[GITA:11299] worship and sacrifices, is it possible that ritualists view the worship of the
[GITA:11300] Lord Almighty as exceedingly difficult and hence propitiate other, l esser
[GITA:11301] deities? This verse clarifies that there is no difficulty involved in
[GITA:11302] worshipping the Lord who does not expect any grand worship. He expects
[GITA:11303] sincerity and unconditional devotion. Anything offered by such devotees
[GITA:11304] even if it is a leaf or a flower or a  fruit or even water is gladly accepted by
[GITA:11305] the Lord . This again proves that the attitude of ritualist s in resorting to
[GITA:11306] indirect worship of the Lord is due to their lack of understanding of His
[GITA:11307] true attributes.
[GITA:11309] In great epics such as the Mahabharata, the Ramayana, and the
[GITA:11310] Bhagavata, the Lord is seen accepting with pleasure even ordinary
[GITA:11311] substances such as a leftover leaf (as in the case of Draupadi) or a flower
[GITA:11312] (as in the case of Gajendra) or a fruit (as in the case of Shabari). Sri
[GITA:11313] Vidyamanya Teertha in his GPM offers an interesting interpretation of this
[GITA:11325] 238                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:11326] verse. Leaf here refers to the Vedas (as per Gita (15.1) where the Vedas are
[GITA:11327] compared to the leaf of a Banyan tree which represents the universe) and
[GITA:11328] hence worship with  a leaf means worshipping the Lord th rough proper
[GITA:11329] understanding of the Vedas. Flower refers to non-violence among the eight
[GITA:11330] flowers that are dear to the Lord as per the scriptural saying ahimsa
[GITA:11331] prathamam pushpam . T he other seven flowers are  - self-control,
[GITA:11332] compassion to all beings, forgivenes s, knowledge, penance, truth, and
[GITA:11333] dhyana meditation. Offering some fruit refers to the act of performing
[GITA:11334] duties without any expectations o f rewards. Offering water refers to the
[GITA:11335] teary eyes that one experiences because of intense, unconditional prayer to
[GITA:11336] the Lord.

[GITA:11386] Comments: The Lord treats everyone impartially with equality.
[GITA:11387] Equality here implies reciprocity. The Lord’s grace is proportional to one’s
[GITA:11388] devotion and likewise, His wrath is also proportional to one’s misdeeds.
[GITA:11389] The Lord never hates sincere devotees and likewise, He never protects
[GITA:11390] enemies who knowingly hate Him.

[GITA:11402] Such a person will immediately focus his/her mind back on righteous

[GITA:11418] Comments: The supremacy of devotion is exemplified in these
[GITA:11419] verses. A similar concept was discussed previously in verse 4.36 where it
[GITA:11420] was indicated that right knowledge will absolve even those who are
[GITA:11421] indulging in misdeeds. Here the Lord is clarifying that such people who
[GITA:11422] have conviction in the Lord Almighty’s supremacy over all other deities
[GITA:11423] and indeed over everything in the universe, will soon get back on the right
[GITA:11424] track and achieve His grace. The discussion here applies to pious souls who
[GITA:11425] due to various reasons such as a curse have strayed onto the wrong path.
[GITA:11427] Souls eligible for liberation who have indulged in sinful activities
[GITA:11428] will have to pay for their misdeeds (such as misery in hell) but due to their
[GITA:11429] innate nature will eventually get back to the right path, develop devotion to
[GITA:11430] the Lord and achieve liberation. Sri Rayaru [GV] clarifies that deities and
[GITA:11431] sages who by nature are pious ( sattvic) may also indulge in misdeeds.  This
[GITA:11432] could happen when they have accumulated positive credits ( punya) beyond
[GITA:11433] their eligibility. They would then experience a reduction in such credits by
[GITA:11434] indulging in misdeeds out of compulsion such as a curse . They would
[GITA:11435] however not have to experience he ll as their misdeeds were beyond their
[GITA:11436] control.

[GITA:11448] It is obvious that those who are born in virtuous families and hol y

[GITA:11466] Comments: Every soul has natural attributes based on which it
[GITA:11467] would take birth to play a spec ific role in society. Sometimes due to sins
[GITA:11468] committed in prior births or due to a curse, it is possible for someone to be
[GITA:11469] born in less hospitable, disadvantageous circumstances where they might
[GITA:11470] not have easy access to education, spiritual learning etc. Eve n those souls
[GITA:11471] can achieve liberation through faith and unflinching devotion to the Lord. It
[GITA:11472] goes without saying that others who are fortunate to have been born in
[GITA:11473] advantageous circumstances (such as birth in pious families, kingly
[GITA:11474] families etc.) are able t o access spiritual education , develop faith in the
[GITA:11475] Lord and achieve liberation. Krishna advi ses Arjuna to make use of the
[GITA:11476] opportunity of his human birth in this transitory and distressful world and
[GITA:11477] perform his prescribed duties with devotion to Him without delay. This is a
[GITA:11478] message that applies to the entire human race.

[GITA:11487] Comments: The Lord concludes the discussion in this unique
[GITA:11488] chapter by exhorting Arjuna to focus his mind, and worship, propitiate and
[GITA:11489] honour Him exclusively. The rewar d for such exclusive devotion to the
[GITA:11490] Lord is liberation ( mukti). As this chapter was focused on the discussion of
[GITA:11491] the Lord’s special attributes, in the concluding verse the Lord encourages
[GITA:11492] Arjuna to develop devotion to Him after getting convinced about His
[GITA:11493] greatness.

[GITA:11510] Summary of Chapter 9
[GITA:11512] While the Lord has infinite auspicious forms, attributes, activities
[GITA:11513] etc., there are eight activities of the Lord that directly impact living beings.
[GITA:11514] These are – creation ( srishti), sustenance ( sthiti), dissolution ( laya),
[GITA:11515] regulation ( niyamana), knowledge ( jnana), ignorance ( ajnana), bondage
[GITA:11516] (bandha), and liberation ( moksha). Together they are called Janmadi
[GITA:11517] ashtaka and they are covered in this chapter. This chapter is called ‘ Raja
[GITA:11518] Vidya Yoga ’ as it teaches these import ant concepts about the Lord. The
[GITA:11519] Lord provides the context for the teachings in  this chapter in verses 9.1,
[GITA:11520] 9.2, and 9.3 where He resolves to imp art both general knowledge (acquired
[GITA:11521] through scriptures  - jnana) and special, divine knowledge about Himself
[GITA:11522] (vijnana). The attribute of sthiti (sustenance) among the eight major
[GITA:11523] attributes of the Lord as they relate to livi ng beings is covered in verses
[GITA:11524] 9.4 – 9.6. In verses 9.7 and 9.8, the Lord’s attributes of creation ( srishti)
[GITA:11525] and dissolution ( laya) are covere d and in 9.10, His attribute of regulation
[GITA:11526] (niyamana) of the universe is discussed. Verse 9.13 describes the attribute
[GITA:11527] of knowledge ( jnana) as it pertains to pious souls , and verses 9.11, 9.12
[GITA:11528] pertain to the attribute of false knowledge ( ajnana) of demoniac souls. In
[GITA:11529] verse 9.1 , the Lord resolved to impart Arjuna both  jnana the general
[GITA:11530] knowledge obtainable through scriptures and very special knowledge about
[GITA:11531] Himself (vijnana). The Lord describes such general knowledge in 12 verses
[GITA:11532] from 9.4 to 9.15 and in four  verses 9.16 to 9.19 , the Lord instructs special,
[GITA:11533] divine knowledge (vijnana) which identifies His presence in all entities, all
[GITA:11534] activities, all sounds and indeed in everything. In verses 9.20 to 9.25, the
[GITA:11535] Lord explains the difference in rewards experienced  by ritualists (those
[GITA:11536] who perform Vedic rituals with expectation s on outcome), and His
[GITA:11548] Chapter 9                                                                                                                                        243
[GITA:11550] unconditional devotees. The supremacy of the path of devotion is described
[GITA:11551] in verses 9.26 – 9.29. Verse 9.28 allude s to the attributes of bondage
[GITA:11552] (bandha) and liberation  (moksha). Verses 9.30 – 9.31 state that even if
[GITA:11553] pious souls indulge in misdeeds (due to some compulsion such as a curse)
[GITA:11554] they will eventually get back to the right path and move towards liberation.
[GITA:11555] In 9.34 the Lord concludes this chapter by instructing Ar juna to focus his
[GITA:11556] mind exclusively on Him, since performing prescribed duties with
[GITA:11557] unconditional devotion will lead one to liberation.

[GITA:11574] Chapter 10 - Divine Manifestations
[GITA:11576] Chapter Introduc tion: Number ten signifies fullness. It is very
[GITA:11577] fitting that the Lord details His greatness in this tenth chapter  of 42 verses.
[GITA:11578] In the 6 th chapter, the Lord provided details of dhyana meditation, and in
[GITA:11579] the last verse of Chapter 9 the Lord taught that one should concentrate and
[GITA:11580] focus the mind exclusively on Him to achieve everlasting bliss ( moksha).
[GITA:11581] For one to develop such firm conviction in meditation, one needs to be
[GITA:11582] fully aware of the Lord’s greatness and attributes. It is also necessary for
[GITA:11583] one to devel op a mental picture of the Lord to focus the mind during
[GITA:11584] meditation. The Lord details many of  His glorious forms from verse 10.21
[GITA:11585] to 10.38 , to aid in meditation. Some of the Lord’s attributes and special
[GITA:11586] presence in activities and enti ties were briefly des cribed in 5.29, 7.8, 9.16
[GITA:11587] etc. More details on these concepts are provided in this grand chapter.

[GITA:11597] will delight in them. (10.1)
[GITA:11599] Comments: The Lord clarifies that Arjuna, being of a pious nature,
[GITA:11600] values knowing about His greatness and will listen to His sermon

[GITA:11622] Even g roups of deities and great sages do not have complete

[GITA:11624] universe. I am the reason for the existence of all deities, all sages and
[GITA:11625] indeed every being, and I am beginningless. (10.2)
[GITA:11627] Comments: The Lord states that even deities and great sages do not
[GITA:11628] know about His greatness and powers completely , which implies that no
[GITA:11629] one in the universe knows the Lord fully. While He is the cause for the
[GITA:11630] creation of the universe and indeed for everyone’s existence, the Lord
[GITA:11631] Himself has no creator. He existed always and will continu e to exist
[GITA:11632] forever. Sri Rayaru in GV  cautions that one should not conclude  that the
[GITA:11633] reason for not knowing about His beginning is due to the difficulty in
[GITA:11634] obtaining such knowledge. The fact is that He is birthless and He always
[GITA:11635] existed. This is different from the incomplete knowledge that one has about
[GITA:11636] His act of creation which occurred, but one cannot completely comprehend.
[GITA:11637] Sri Rayaru provides three interpretations based on Sri Madhw acharya’s GB
[GITA:11638] for the phrase ‘na me vidhuhu ’ (no one knows Me) as follows  - (i) deities
[GITA:11639] and great sages do not understand My greatness fully; (ii) deities and great
[GITA:11640] sages do not understand My act of the creation of the universe completely;
[GITA:11641] (iii) deities and great sages do not fully understand that I have no
[GITA:11642] beginning. Sri Rayaru also quotes  a Brahma Sutra (2.3.9) which states
[GITA:11643] that the Lord is birthless and hence has no beginning.

[GITA:11665] Comments: The word anadi has an interesting i nterpretation by Sri
[GITA:11666] Rayaru in GV . A superficial meaning of anadi is one without beginning.
[GITA:11667] However, the Lord precedes this word by ajam (one without birth) , which
[GITA:11668] also means one without beginning. Dividing the word anadi as ana and adi
[GITA:11669] leads to two interpretations.  Ana means activity, adi is beginning, so anadi
[GITA:11670] means the one who is the cause of activity in everyone. Also, ana means
[GITA:11671] the deity mukhya prana (vayudeva) and hence anadi can also be interpreted
[GITA:11672] as the one who existed even before the deity mukhya prana . This
[GITA:11673] interpretation is also consistent with the Vedic quote in  the Purusha
[GITA:11674] Sookta which states – pranaad vayur ajayatha  (during the process of
[GITA:11675] creation, the deity Vayudeva arose out of the Lord’s breath).

[GITA:11692] in their livelihood and spiritual journey. The Lord not only provides living
[GITA:11693] beings with physical bodies and sense organs to conduct their lives , He also

[GITA:11714] During the period o f the previous Manu, I created the seven great
[GITA:11715] sages, the deities who emanated from the mind of  Brahma, and the four
[GITA:11716] Manu deities. Their progeny in turn populated the universe. (10.6)
[GITA:11718] Comments: The Lord stated previously that He is the cause for the
[GITA:11719] creation of all living beings. Here He is describing the details of such a
[GITA:11720] creation. The Lord initially created the seven great sages (Mareechi, Atri,
[GITA:11721] Angeerasa, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratu, V asishta). Sri Rayaru in GV  explains
[GITA:11722] that Manu also means one endowed with  knowledge and hence Manu
[GITA:11723] deities also are all deities starting from four faced Brahma. The Lord
[GITA:11724] initially created Brahma and through him all other deities were created. The
[GITA:11725] progeny of the seven sages and the deities then populated the universe. The
[GITA:11726] reference to four types of Manu deities indicate s the categorization of
[GITA:11727] deities into four categories like human beings  described previously in
[GITA:11728] chapter 4 (4.13).  Brahmanas, kshatriyas, vyshyas and shudras are the four
[GITA:11729] classes of deities. Brahma belongs to the category of Brahmana . Deities
[GITA:11730] such as Vayudeva, Seshadeva, Rudradeva, Garuda, Indra are Kshat riyas
[GITA:11731] etc. It was clarified in 4.13  that the four categories in society are based on
[GITA:11732] the innate nature and talent of souls and , no category is superior to another.
[GITA:11733] In fact 4.13  uses the word varna which means colour. Thus, the four
[GITA:11734] categories are different like colours are different and one should not
[GITA:11735] confuse them with the caste system prevalent in society. The fact that these
[GITA:11736] types of categories exist even among deit ies is proof that one should not
[GITA:11737] grade people based on their classification.

[GITA:11799] For those who immerse their minds in Me and worship Me with
[GITA:11800] affection, I grant wisdom with which they can attain My abode. (10.10)
[GITA:11802] Comments: In this verse the Lord states that He rewards His
[GITA:11803] devotees with the knowledge and wisdom they need to achieve liberation.
[GITA:11804] His devotees who worship Him with single minded focus (described in
[GITA:11805] verses 10.7 – 10.9), having understood His greatness (summarized in verses
[GITA:11806] 10.2 – 10.6), are accordingly rewarded.
[GITA:11808] This verse is identified as the summary of this entire ch apter by Sri
[GITA:11809] Madinur Vishnu Teertha in his BGS  as it summarizes the reward for a
[GITA:11810] seeker who truly understands  the Lord’s prowess. This is also explained in
[GITA:11811] more detail in later verses.
[GITA:11813] Author’s Note: There is a curious mathematical aspect to this verse.
[GITA:11814] This 10 th verse in this 10 th chapter has 10 words! It was stated in  the
[GITA:11815] introduction that the number 10 stands for fullness. Also, 10*10*10 = 1000
[GITA:11816] symbolizes the 1000 names of the Lord as in the Vishnu Sahasra Nama. It
[GITA:11817] is very apt that this verse is the summary of this chapter.

[GITA:11826] Comments: In addition to rewarding His ardent devotees with
[GITA:11827] knowledge to achieve liberation, the Lord states that He frees their minds
[GITA:11828] and shatters any ill-feelings and misery. After all, for one to develop a deep
[GITA:11829] conviction in divine knowledge, one ’s mind mu st be freed from misery,

[GITA:11870] You have also taught me the same. (10.12) (10.13)
[GITA:11872] O Keshava! I trust everything you have said to me . O Lord! Neither
[GITA:11873] great deities nor demons, nor indeed any others  know you fully. O
[GITA:11874] Purushottama! Controller of the universe, and Lord of everyone and
[GITA:11875] everything. Only you know yourself fully. (10.14) (10.15)
[GITA:11887] Chapter 10                                                                                                                                     251
[GITA:11889] Please educate me about your divine majestic forms with which you
[GITA:11890] pervade this universe. O Lord of Infinite Abilities! How should I be
[GITA:11891] thinking about you? O Supreme Lord! How do I visualize you and your
[GITA:11892] presence in different entities in this universe? O Janardana! Tell me more
[GITA:11893] details about your supreme abilities and majes tic forms. I will never be
[GITA:11894] satisfied with any amount of your sweet nectarine words. (10.16) (10.17)
[GITA:11895] (10.18)
[GITA:11897] Comments: After hearing about the Lord’s greatness and attributes
[GITA:11898] in brief, Arjuna  is now curious and interested in learning more. He states
[GITA:11899] that great sages and deities have praised the Lord’s attributes and the Lord
[GITA:11900] Himself has reiterated them. Further, Arjuna knows that even great deities
[GITA:11901] are not capable of fully knowing the Lord who is the creator of even
[GITA:11902] Brahma and Rudra (indicated by the use of  the Lord’s name Keshava in
[GITA:11903] 10.14, where ka refers to Brahma and Isha refers to Rudra, and Keshava is
[GITA:11904] in fact the one who created both Brahma and Rudra). Only the Lord knows
[GITA:11905] His forms fully. Arjuna further states that for one to meditate on the Lord, it
[GITA:11906] is important for one to visualize His forms. Hence, Arjuna would like to
[GITA:11907] learn about the Lord’s majestic forms. In 10.16, Arjuna requests the Lord to
[GITA:11908] teach him fully about His forms. Arjuna is never satisfied with any amount
[GITA:11909] of the sweet nectarine words of t he Lord.  In 10.16, Arjuna uses the term
[GITA:11910] vibhuti while referring to the Lord’s form. Sri Rayaru in GV  explains that
[GITA:11911] vibhuti has two different meanings. Firstly, vibhuti = vividhatayaa
[GITA:11912] bhootayaha meaning different forms of the Lord such as Rama, Krishna
[GITA:11913] etc., and secondly vibhuti = vishishtaha bhootayaha , meaning the form of
[GITA:11914] the Lord that bestows superiority to a specific entity or quality among its
[GITA:11915] peers. These will be detailed in later verses.

[GITA:11938] The Lord said:  O Arjuna, Superior among Kurus! I will tell you
[GITA:11939] about some of My main  majestic forms. There is no end to My forms.
[GITA:11940] (10.19)
[GITA:11942] O Gudakesha (Arjuna, one who has conquered sleep)! I am
[GITA:11943] omnipresent, I exist in the heart s of all living beings, and I power their
[GITA:11944] existence. I am responsible for the creation, sustenance, and dissolution of
[GITA:11945] all beings. (10.20)
[GITA:11947] Comments: The Lord is pleased with Arjuna’s sincerity and
[GITA:11948] curiosity and resolves to teach him about His majestic forms. The Lord
[GITA:11949] confirms that He has infinite forms. This seems to be in response to
[GITA:11950] Arjuna’s request in 10.16, where he wanted to learn about the Lord’s forms
[GITA:11951] fully (without leaving anything out). After all, not even great deities know
[GITA:11952] fully about the Lord’s forms or attributes. In 10.20, the Lord states that
[GITA:11953] while He has special presence in many entities , He is present in everyone’s
[GITA:11954] hearts, and He is the cause for the creation, the sustenance, and the
[GITA:11955] dissolution of the universe.
[GITA:11957] In the next 18 verses from 10.21 to 10.38, the Lord explains in detail
[GITA:11958] His specific, majestic forms. This group of verses is one of the mos t
[GITA:11959] important parts of the Gita.
[GITA:11961] Sri Rayaru in GV  explains that vibhuti roopa (divine manifestations)
[GITA:11962] are of two types – direct forms and hidden forms. The Lord describes both
[GITA:11963] types of manifestations. Direct form refers to His forms of Rama, Krishna,
[GITA:11964] Vyasa, Kapila etc., while the hidden forms refer to the Lord’s form resident
[GITA:11965] in specific objects that gives them supremacy. The hidden forms are of
[GITA:11966] three types: (i) supreme among similar objects, (ii) supreme among
[GITA:11967] dissimilar objects wh ich share a common conditi on, and (iii) supreme
[GITA:11968] among objects except for an obvious leader. These categories are identified
[GITA:11980] Chapter 10                                                                                                                                     253
[GITA:11982] in Sri Madhwacharya’s GTN  referring to an ancient work , the Vibhuti
[GITA:11983] Tattva. These categories will be identified in later verses. Also, Sri Rayaru
[GITA:11984] uses shabda nishpatti (word derivation) to indicate the specific attribute of
[GITA:11985] the Lord signified by the name of the chosen superior entity in each class.

[GITA:11990] Among the twelve Adityas, I a m Vishnu. Among all radiant objects,
[GITA:11991] I am Ravi (Sun). I am Marichi among the Marut deities. I am The Moon
[GITA:11992] among the constellations of the stars in the night sky  (Resident in the Sun,
[GITA:11993] Marichi, and the Moon, I grant them superiority among their peers). (10.21)
[GITA:11995] Comments: Among the twelve children of Aditi, the Lord is Vishnu
[GITA:11996] (Vishnu = vyaptatvaat sarveshu pratishtatvaat  = the one who pervades the
[GITA:11997] universe and is resident in all). Among all luminous objects, He is Ravi
[GITA:11998] (rashmi yukto  = one who is full of infini te glow). Among the 49 Marut
[GITA:11999] deities He is Marichi ( marinam charayati  = the one who moves clouds).
[GITA:12000] Among stars, He is Shashi/Moon ( shashaha asya aasteeti = one who is full
[GITA:12001] of happiness).
[GITA:12003] In this verse, one can see examples of the different categories of t he
[GITA:12004] Lord’s manifestations. Vishnu is one of His direct manifestations. The
[GITA:12005] other three entities identified – Ravi, Marichi, Shashi are indirect
[GITA:12006] manifestations. Also, Ravi (Sun) is chosen as supreme among similar
[GITA:12007] radiant entities, while Shashi (the Moon) is indicated as supreme among the
[GITA:12008] stars. The Moon is not a star. However, it is the brightest object in the night
[GITA:12009] sky. This is an example of a superior object among dissimilar objects
[GITA:12010] (Moon and Stars) that share a common condition ( the night sky).  The
[GITA:12011] Lord’s special presence in the chosen superior object is signified by the
[GITA:12012] Lord’s attribute as explained by Sri Rayaru in GV through word derivation.
[GITA:12013] For example, Ravi is the worldly name one uses for the Sun, but primarily
[GITA:12014] Ravi means the one who is full of infini te glow, a reference to  the Lord
[GITA:12015] Almighty. This discussion applies to all other superior forms  as well.

[GITA:12047] Comments: The Lord’s forms are derived as follows. Shankara (one
[GITA:12048] who is the cause of happiness), Vittesha (owner of all wealth), Pavaka
[GITA:12049] (purifier of everything) and Meru (one who is not activated by some other
[GITA:12050] entity). As indicated before, Shankara is the n ame for the supreme among
[GITA:12051] the Rudra deities and he derives his superiority and name from the Lord
[GITA:12052] whose attribute is identified by the derivation of the word Shankara.

[GITA:12089] Himalaya (the one who is the shelter for the two forms of Lakshmi – hree

[GITA:12101] Comments: The Lord is known as Ashwattha (the one with a horse

[GITA:12103] (the one who fulfills the wishes of humans as nara means human). He is
[GITA:12104] known as Chitraratha (the one with the spectacular chariot as ratha means
[GITA:12105] chariot). Among sages He is Kapila wh o is a direc t form of the Lord
[GITA:12106] Almighty where kapila means one who is the embodiment of happiness,
[GITA:12118] 256                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:12119] protects the universe and dissolves it within Himself during the great
[GITA:12120] dissolution (ka means happiness, pi which leads to palana means one who
[GITA:12121] protects and la which lead s to laya means one who absorbs the universe
[GITA:12122] during dissolution).
[GITA:12124] HH Sri Vidyasagara Madhava  Teertha offers another unique
[GITA:12125] derivation for the word Kapila as  kapi + la where, kapi indicates monkey
[GITA:12126] like unsteadiness and la stands for layati (destruction). Thus, Kapila can
[GITA:12127] also be interpreted as the attribute of the Lord Almighty who destroys the

[GITA:12177] attributes). He is Varuna (the one who grants the ultimate abode of bliss -
[GITA:12178] moksha) and Aryama (omniscient). He is Yama (the one who grants the
[GITA:12179] power of regulation).
[GITA:12181] It must be noted that  the deity Varuna in whom the Lord resides by

[GITA:12395] Thus in 18 verses from 10.21 to 10.38 , the Lord describe s His presence
[GITA:12396] in various entities and objects giving them superiority am ong their peers.
[GITA:12397] Sri Rayaru in GV  clarifies that the Lord has identified some entities as
[GITA:12398] having His special presence though they were not the obvious leaders in
[GITA:12399] those categories. These are -
[GITA:12401]  Samaveda in 10.22, where Rig Veda is known as the superior among
[GITA:12402] the Vedas.
[GITA:12403]  Vasava (deity Indra) in 10.22 , where Lakshmi, Brahma etc., are
[GITA:12404] known to be superior to Indra.
[GITA:12405]  japa (meditation) among ways of worship in 10.25 , where jnana
[GITA:12406] (worship through knowledg e) is known to be superior among ways
[GITA:12407] of worship.
[GITA:12408]  vajra (diamond) among weapons in 10.28 , where chakra (disc) is
[GITA:12409] known to be superior among weapons.
[GITA:12410]  ushana (Shukracharya) among scholars in 10.37 , where deity
[GITA:12411] Brahma is known to be superior among scholars.
[GITA:12412]  Dhananjaya (Arjuna) among the Pandavas in 10.37 , where Bh eema
[GITA:12413] is known to be superior among the Pandavas.
[GITA:12415] As per Sri Madhwacharya’s GTN, the above entities are identified as
[GITA:12416] having the special presence of the Lord as cases to illustrate their
[GITA:12417] superiority a mong other subcategories within a main category. This was
[GITA:12418] explained in the comment section of verses 10.19 and 10.20 , where it was
[GITA:12419] stated that the supremacy of the Lord among His hidden forms is of three
[GITA:12420] types: (i) supreme among similar objects, (ii) supre me among dissimilar
[GITA:12421] objects who share a common condition, and (iii) supreme among objects
[GITA:12422] except for an obvious leader. For example, among deities, after the Lord,
[GITA:12423] the order of gradation is Sri Lakshmi, Brahma, Vayu, Saraswathi, Bharati,
[GITA:12424] Sesha, Garuda, Rudra, Varuni, Sowparni, Parvati and then Indra. However,
[GITA:12425] Indra is superior among the deities in Swarga Loka (heaven).

[GITA:12485] Comments: The Lord further clarifies that the supremacy in any
[GITA:12486] attribute or quality visible in any entity is due only to an infinitesimal
[GITA:12487] fraction of the Lord’s special presence in them. Hence, the Sun (Ravi) who
[GITA:12488] is supreme among all glowing objects exhibits suc h supremacy due to the
[GITA:12489] presence of a minute fraction of the Lord’s glory. This is different from the

[GITA:12500] Comments: The intent of the Lord’s question is to caution Arjuna
[GITA:12501] (and everyone else) that one should not conclude that His forms are limited
[GITA:12502] to those identified in this chapter as they represent a miniscule fraction of
[GITA:12503] His infinite forms. There will be more description about the Lord’s
[GITA:12504] pervasiveness in future chapters. This ch apter is a prelude to the glorious
[GITA:12505] universal form of the Lord which will be covered in the next chapter.
[GITA:12507] Summary of Chapter 10
[GITA:12509] In this chapter, the Lord details His forms and presence in many
[GITA:12510] entities, attributes in response to Arjuna’s ques tions which a ppeared in
[GITA:12511] verses 10.12 to 10.18 . Arjuna was keen to learn about the Lord’s divine
[GITA:12512] glories and countless manifestations as one needs to form a mental image
[GITA:12513] of the Lord to visualize Him during concentrated meditation. The Lord
[GITA:12514] identifies His divine manifest ations and special presence in entities which
[GITA:12515] gives them superiority. These a re described in 18 verses from 10.21 to
[GITA:12516] 10.38. Sri Rayaru in GV  explains that vibhuti roopa (divine manifestation)
[GITA:12517] is of two types – direct forms and hidden forms. Direct form ref ers to His
[GITA:12518] forms of Vishnu, Rama, Krishna, Vyasa, Kapila etc., while hidden forms
[GITA:12530] Chapter 10                                                                                                                                     265
[GITA:12532] refer to the Lord’s presence in specific entities that gives them supremacy.
[GITA:12533] The superiority among the hidden forms are of three types: (i) supreme
[GITA:12534] among similar objects, (ii) supreme among dissimilar objects which share a
[GITA:12535] common condition, and (iii) supreme among objects except for an obvious
[GITA:12536] leader. Also, Sri Rayaru uses shabda nishpatti (word derivation) to indicate
[GITA:12537] the specific attribute of the Lord signified by the name o f the chosen
[GITA:12538] superior entity in each class.  In verse 10.21 , He identifies Ravi (sun) as the
[GITA:12539] entity that is superior among similar objects, namely luminaries. In the
[GITA:12540] same verse, the Lord also identifies Shashi ( Moon) as superior among stars.
[GITA:12541] The Moon is not a star. However, the Moon and the stars share the common
[GITA:12542] attribute of being visible in the night sky. In that sense, the Moon is
[GITA:12543] superior to the stars. This is an example of an entity that is superior amon g
[GITA:12544] dissimilar objects. In verse 10.22 , He identifi es sama veda  as superior
[GITA:12545] among the Vedas. However, it is well known that Rig veda is the superior.
[GITA:12546] So, the interpretation here is that the Lord is identifying Sama veda among
[GITA:12547] the Vedas except for the obvious leader (namely Rig Veda ). This is also
[GITA:12548] seen in verse 10.25, where the Lord identified japa (meditation) as superior
[GITA:12549] among the forms of worship where one knows that jnana (knowledge) is
[GITA:12550] the supreme form. In addition to such entities (both sentient and inert such
[GITA:12551] as mountains, rivers etc.), the Lord also signifies His presence in qualities
[GITA:12552] and attributes  such as fame, memory, intellect, tolerance etc.,  as seen in
[GITA:12553] verse 10.34 , and also in activities such as gambling in 10.36. In verse
[GITA:12554] 10.16, Arjuna had requested the Lord to teach him completely about His
[GITA:12555] majestic forms and manifestations , and after describing His d ivine
[GITA:12556] manifestations in verses 10.21 to 10.38, the Lord declares in verse 10.40 ,
[GITA:12557] that His forms are infinite , implying that no one can completely
[GITA:12558] comprehend Him.  The Lord concludes His sermon on His majestic forms
[GITA:12559] by cautioning Arjuna that he should not assume that the Lord’s various
[GITA:12560] forms are limited to those described in this chapter because they are infinite
[GITA:12561] and expansive. This is a prelude to the description of the Lord’s universal
[GITA:12562] form (next chapter).

[GITA:12579] Chapter 11 - The Lord’s Universal Form
[GITA:12581] Chapter Introduction:  This chapter of 55 verses is termed Vishwa
[GITA:12582] Roopa Darshana m (The Lord’s Universal Form). In the concluding ver se
[GITA:12583] of the previous chapter , the Lord declar es that He has presence in
[GITA:12584] everything in the universe and just a minute fraction of His energy causes
[GITA:12585] superiority in many objects. The Lord also indicates that previous teachings
[GITA:12586] provide only a glimpse of His powe rs. This chapter conveys more details
[GITA:12587] about His forms. After listening to the Lord’s teachings on His divine
[GITA:12588] manifestations, His amazing activities in terms of creation of the universe
[GITA:12589] etc., Arjuna is naturally curious to behold the Lord’s omnipotent form.  The
[GITA:12590] Lord grants Arjuna’s wish by giving him Divine Vision before exhibiting
[GITA:12591] His grand, Universal form which is the quintessential feature of this
[GITA:12592] chapter. The description of the Lord’s Universal Form mirrors the
[GITA:12593] description in the Purusha Sookta (the Nature of Cosmic Being), from  the
[GITA:12594] Rig Veda which is considered the primordial group of hymns that gave rise
[GITA:12595] to the entire  span of  Vedic literature. In that sense this chapter is like a
[GITA:12596] commentary on the Purusha Sookta. This chapter also has a soulful prayer
[GITA:12597] by Arjuna on seeing the Lord’s universal form. While the Lord had
[GITA:12598] previously taught Arjuna about His greatness and attributes, the act of
[GITA:12599] physically seeing the Lord’s universal form completely solidifies Arjuna’s
[GITA:12600] conviction in Sri Krishna’s teachings.

[GITA:12629] Arjuna said: O Krishna! Out of compassion, You blessed me with
[GITA:12630] the most secret divine knowledge. My ignorance is  dispelled by Your
[GITA:12631] words. (11.1)
[GITA:12633] O Krishna,  One with Lotus Eyes! I understood about th e cycle of
[GITA:12634] births and deaths of  living beings. I also learnt about Your infinite
[GITA:12635] greatness. (11.2)
[GITA:12637] O  Supreme Lord! It is true that You taught me a lot about Your
[GITA:12638] attributes and forms. O Supreme among All Beings! I crave to have a
[GITA:12639] vision of Your great, unimaginable majestic form. (11.3)
[GITA:12641] O  Lord of Yogas! If you feel that I can see  Your form physically,
[GITA:12642] please show me Your Universal form that has no end. (11.4)
[GITA:12644] Comments: Arjuna , after hearing about the Lord’s divine
[GITA:12645] manifestations and His amazing activities, is now craving to have a vision
[GITA:12646] of the Lord’s form. After all, no amount of studying or listening about the
[GITA:12647] Lord can be compared to the experience of directly seeing the Lord. Also, a
[GITA:12648] direct vision of the Lord is extremely helpful for one during meditation.
[GITA:12649] Hence, Arjuna requests the Lord to grant him a vision of His magnificent
[GITA:12650] form. Arjuna also knows that the Lord is beyond the perception of sense
[GITA:12651] organs which he in dicates by addressing the Lord as Prabhu in verse 11.4 .
[GITA:12652] However, Arjuna also addresses the Lord as Yogeshwara (one who is the
[GITA:12653] master of all yogas - ways and means), implying that the Lord w ould guide
[GITA:12654] him on the sure path to a direct vision of His Supreme f orm. Arju na
[GITA:12655] humbly requests the Lord in 11.4  that if He felt  that he is eligible and
[GITA:12667] 268                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:12668] capable of seeing His imperishable form, then the Lord should grant him
[GITA:12669] that vision.

[GITA:12688] forms. (11.5)
[GITA:12690] O Bharata! See all deities - Adityas, Vasus, Rudras, Ashw ini twins,
[GITA:12691] Maruts - in Me. Also see many amazing, astonishing things you have never
[GITA:12692] seen before. (11.6)
[GITA:12694] O Gudakesha! In My Universal form, you can see the entire universe
[GITA:12695] with all animate and inanimate objects in one place. You can see
[GITA:12696] everything you wish to see here. (11.7)
[GITA:12698] But you will not be able to see My Universal form with your normal
[GITA:12699] eyes. I grant you Divine Vision with which you will be able to view My
[GITA:12700] supreme splendor. (11.8)
[GITA:12712] Chapter 11                                                                                                                                          269
[GITA:12714] Comments: The Lord having been humbly prayed  to by Arjuna,
[GITA:12715] resolves to grant Arjuna the vision of His magnificent Universal Form.
[GITA:12716] The reference to hundreds and thousands  in 11.5 indicates innumerable or
[GITA:12717] infinite forms. The Lord displays all deities in His form as well as many
[GITA:12718] astonishing, indescribable entities that Arjuna has never seen before. He
[GITA:12719] also tells Arjuna to see in Him all entities in the universe and anything else
[GITA:12720] that he can imagine. In 11.8 , the Lord confirms that Arjuna w ould not be
[GITA:12721] able to see His Universal Form with his normal eyes and that He would
[GITA:12722] grant Arjuna a pair of divine eyes to behold His Universal Form.

[GITA:12736] Comments: At this stage, Sanjaya informs King Dhrutarashtra that
[GITA:12737] Lord Hari accedes to Arjuna’s request and displays His magnificent
[GITA:12738] Universal Form. (Hari, as the Lord is referred to here has at least two
[GITA:12739] meanings – the one who consumes the offerings from devotees’ sacrifices
[GITA:12740] and one who is coloured green). Those who had gathered in the battle
[GITA:12741] ground were able to view the Lord’s Univers al form to the extent of their

[GITA:12769] The Lord’s Universal form is sporting divine g arlands, divine
[GITA:12770] clothes, divine   sandal wood paste, is full of infinite amazing, wondrous
[GITA:12771] attributes (such as knowledge, bliss) with faces on all sides. (11.11)
[GITA:12773] That exalted Universal form has the brightness of thousands and
[GITA:12774] thousands (countless) of Suns rising altogether at the same time. (11.12)
[GITA:12776] Comments: Sanjaya describes the Lord’s form as seen by him. It
[GITA:12777] must be remembered that h e is relaying the proceedings of  the war to King
[GITA:12778] Dhrutarashtra, as Lord Vedavyasa had granted Sanjaya the ability to
[GITA:12779] visualize the war from a distance . Lord Vedavyasa is another for m of Lord
[GITA:12780] Krishna, as per 10.37 . So it is not a surprise that Sanjaya was also able to
[GITA:12781] visualize the Lord’s Universal form which otherwise was not visible to
[GITA:12782] normal human eyes. The description in 11 .10 about the Lord’s attributes is
[GITA:12783] consistent with the one in the Purusha Sookta.
[GITA:12785] The fact that Arjuna was able to view the Lord’s Universal Form
[GITA:12786] with the entire universe in it , in the background of the battle field, also
[GITA:12787] proves that the universe is indeed  a real entity and not an illusion. Of
[GITA:12788] course, Arjuna required the Divine Vision granted to him by the Lord to
[GITA:12789] view the universe pervaded by Him.

[GITA:12815] Arjuna, trembling with tears in his eyes and immersed in

[GITA:12819] Comments: Arjuna, after viewing the Lord’s Universal Form in all
[GITA:12820] its glory, is overcome with emotion. He  describes the Lord’s Universal
[GITA:12821] Form in the following 17 verses with tears of joy in his eyes.

[GITA:12834] Comments: The four faced deity Brahma shelters in the Lord
[GITA:12835] Almighty, Rudra similarly shelters in Brahma  (symbolically indicated by

[GITA:12917] Comments: The Lord’s form appears threatening as He prepares to
[GITA:12918] lift the burden Mother Earth is carrying. Evil doers are a burden on ea rth
[GITA:12919] and from time to time the Lord devises ways to lessen this load. The war of
[GITA:12920] the Mahabharata is one such instance. The Lord does appear cruel and
[GITA:12921] threatening to evil doers because they are guilty of wicked acts. Realised
[GITA:12922] souls such as Brahma, Rudra who are used to the vision of the Lord are not
[GITA:12923] threatened by this form. In Bhagavata [BMP], Canto 7, Prahlada was
[GITA:12924] praying to Lord Narasimha who had taken a frightening form while killing
[GITA:12925] the evil demon, Hiranyakashipu. Prahlada states that superior deities who
[GITA:12926] had gathered there (such as Brahma, Rudra) were not frightened by the
[GITA:12927] Lord’s form as they were realized souls and were used to viewing such
[GITA:12928] forms of the Lord.

[GITA:12949] Comments: Verse 11.15 described deities sheltered in the Lord and
[GITA:12950] in this verse, deities are described as entering and leaving the Lord’s form

[GITA:12952] and the reference in this verse is to deities who are liberated. This is

[GITA:12964] ancestral deities. This is because these deities consume the vapours from

[GITA:12990] O Krishna, Mighty Armed One! Your form is magnificent and huge.
[GITA:12991] It has infinite faces, eyes, shoulders, thighs, feet, abd omens and sharp tusk
[GITA:12992] and teeth. All three worlds are terrified and so am I. (11.23)
[GITA:12994] O Vishnu! Your form touches the sky, dazzling in many colours with
[GITA:12995] large glowing eyes and mouth wide open.  Looking at this, my mind is full
[GITA:12996] of fear. I am trembling, unable to stay steady. (11.24)
[GITA:12998] O Lord of All Deities! Looking at Your infinite faces glowing like

[GITA:13001] on me. (11.25)
[GITA:13003] Comments: Verse 11.23 refers to the Lord’s face, shoulders, thighs,
[GITA:13004] and feet. This is like the description in the Purusha Sookta  where it was
[GITA:13005] stated that during the creation of the universe, four categories of population
[GITA:13006] with four different nature an d qualities were born out of the Lord’s face,
[GITA:13007] shoulders, thig hs, and feet. Verse 11.24  describes the Lord’s mouth as
[GITA:13008] being open since the Lord is preparing to destroy millions during the war
[GITA:13009] and consume them.

[GITA:13017] Bheeshma, Drona, Karna , the son of Soota, and all the sons of

[GITA:13031] 276                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:13032] dreadful, sharp teeth and many are seen with their heads smashed and stuck
[GITA:13033] between Your teeth. (11.26) (11.27)
[GITA:13035] Comments: The refere nce to the Kauravas and other warriors seen
[GITA:13036] entering the Lord’s open mouth , which has sharp, dreadful teeth is a
[GITA:13037] symbolic way of indicating their impending death in the war. A question
[GITA:13038] that arises currently is as follows. If the Gita was taught by Lord Krishna to
[GITA:13039] Arjuna before the start of the war, how could Arjuna see the vision of many
[GITA:13040] warriors dying in the war as  indicated here. Sri Rayaru in GV  explains that
[GITA:13041] Arjuna was granted Divine Vision by the Lord so that he could  see the His
[GITA:13042] Universal Form. The sa me Divine Vision also gave Arjuna the ability to
[GITA:13043] see things that would happen in the future.
[GITA:13045] Sri Rayaru in GV  explains that deities who have Divine Vision can
[GITA:13046] view things with infinite precision. In the epic Vishnu Dharma, there is an
[GITA:13047] episode related to K ing Puroorava and the Ashwini deities who visit him.
[GITA:13048] The King requests them to wait a short while as he wants  to see them after
[GITA:13049] taking a shower and dressing himself in his royal clothes  and ornaments.
[GITA:13050] The deities see him later and laugh at him. The King as ks the deities the
[GITA:13051] reason for their reaction. They say that even though the King took just
[GITA:13052] some time to get himself dressed; he had grown a little older during that
[GITA:13053] time. The implication here is that though everyone grows old every minute
[GITA:13054] of the day,  no one can see or feel the minute changes in their bodies. But
[GITA:13055] the Ashwini deities because of their divine eyesight were able to see even
[GITA:13056] the minutest change in the King’s body during the time that he took to dress
[GITA:13057] himself.

[GITA:13078] Just as currents of water from all rivers flood into the ocean, brave
[GITA:13079] warriors from this world are seen hur tling into Your burning mouth from
[GITA:13080] all directions. (11.28)
[GITA:13082] Just as moths crash into a blazing fire with great speed and perish,
[GITA:13083] many of these warriors are running into your mouth with great speed only
[GITA:13084] to get destroyed. (11.29)
[GITA:13086] Comments: These two verses identify the warriors who are shown
[GITA:13087] to be entering the Lord’s mouth as a symbolic way of describi ng their
[GITA:13088] imminent death. Verse 11.28  which refers to veera (brave) warriors seem s
[GITA:13089] to be referring to sattvic warriors who are fight ing for a just cause , and are
[GITA:13090] hurtling into the Lord’s mouth, just like rivers merging into a majestic
[GITA:13091] ocean, which is a natural event. Verse 11.29 describes warriors rushing into
[GITA:13092] their deaths just like moth s rush towards a blazing fire. This seems to be
[GITA:13093] referring to evil warriors who by nature are drawn to sinful activities even
[GITA:13094] when they know the perils associated with such actions.

[GITA:13123] Comments: Verse 11.30  describes the Lord’s form which is
[GITA:13124] terrifying and threatening. Arjuna who had heard about the Lord’s
[GITA:13125] compassionate qualities is perplexed .  In verse 11.31, He states that while
[GITA:13126] the Lord has described His attributes and q ualities earlier, he is unable to
[GITA:13127] understand why He is now displaying such a terrifying form.

[GITA:13138] (11.32)
[GITA:13140] Comments: Lord Krishna responds to Arjuna’s question about His
[GITA:13141] form and states that one of His activities is destruction of evil doers. The
[GITA:13142] Lord had declared previously in 4.7 and 4.8  that He would incarnate
[GITA:13143] Himself from time to time to protect virtuous liv es and to destroy evil
[GITA:13144] doers. Such a time had come now where evil forces were controlling much
[GITA:13145] of Bharat and the Lord’s incarnation as Sri Krishna was designed to destroy
[GITA:13146] the evil and reestablish Dharma. The Lord assures Arjuna that most soldiers
[GITA:13147] would perish in the  war with the exception of Arjuna himself and a few
[GITA:13148] others. The Lord uses the term ‘ api’ meaning ‘also’ to indicate ‘others’
[GITA:13149] who will survive the war. Sri Rayaru in GV  clarifies that ‘others’ refers to
[GITA:13150] Arjuna’s four brothers and three warriors from the oth er side,
[GITA:13151] Ashwatthama, Kruta varma and Krupacharya. This is as per the Souptika
[GITA:13152] Parva chapter of the Mahabharata.

[GITA:13172] O Savyasachi (Arjuna, the one who is ambidextrous)! Therefore, lift
[GITA:13173] yourself up and wage this just war. Defeat your enemies and achieve fame.
[GITA:13174] Enjoy the plentiful kingdom. All these warriors have already been killed by
[GITA:13175] Me. You are a mere instrument in this act of war. (11.33)
[GITA:13177] All brave warriors such as Bheeshma, Drona, Jayadratha, Karna have
[GITA:13178] already been killed by Me. You do not need to grieve. Wage the war and go
[GITA:13179] through the formality of killing them. You will be victorious in this war.
[GITA:13180] (11.34)
[GITA:13182] Comments: In verse 2.6, Arjuna had expressed doubts as to whether
[GITA:13183] he would win the war. The Lord had instructed him that he should wage the
[GITA:13184] war as it was his duty to do so . Lord Krishna had a lso stated in verse 2.37 ,
[GITA:13185] that Arjuna st ood to gain regardless of victory or defeat in the war. If he
[GITA:13186] won, he w ould enjoy ruling the prosperous kingdom , and if he los t his life
[GITA:13187] he w ould attain heaven for diligently performing his prescr ibed duty. In
[GITA:13188] these verses, the Lord goes a step further and tells Arjuna that victory was a
[GITA:13189] certainty as He had already planned death for the Kauravas, and Arjuna had
[GITA:13190] only to go through the formality of fighting the war to preserve his fame. In
[GITA:13191] verse 11.34, the Lord explicitly names Kaurava warriors Bheeshma, Drona,
[GITA:13192] Jayadratha, and Karna as the ones whose death s were preordained. Sri
[GITA:13193] Rayaru clarifies in GV  that these warriors were protected with specific
[GITA:13194] boons that would have rendered them impossible to co nquer, so Arjuna’s
[GITA:13195] apprehension about their invincibility was understandable.  The Lord puts
[GITA:13196] Arjuna’s mind at ease by stating that even these warriors would perish in
[GITA:13197] the war (Later in the war, these warriors would encounter unique situations
[GITA:13198] where they wou ld perish without contradicting the powers, they possessed
[GITA:13199] due to prior boons).

[GITA:13223] Comments: In response to King Dhrutarashtra’s curiosity about
[GITA:13224] further developments in the war, Sanjaya states that Arjuna who was
[GITA:13225] terrified at the Lord’s magnificent but frightening form starts addressing the
[GITA:13226] Lord in a trembling voice.  As will be seen later, Arjuna is also concerned
[GITA:13227] that he might have treated Krishna as just a normal friend without being
[GITA:13228] fully aware of His greatness , and thi s concern could also have led to
[GITA:13229] Arjuna’s fear.

[GITA:13260] without end, Lord of all Lords, supporter of the Universe, and You are
[GITA:13261] imperishable. You are superior to every entity, manifest and unmanifest, in
[GITA:13262] the universe. (11.37)
[GITA:13264] Comments: Arjuna prays to the Lord with utmost humility. He
[GITA:13265] recounts the Lord’s greatness as the most superior being in the entire
[GITA:13266] universe and the one who created even four faced Brahma. All deities in the
[GITA:13267] universe bow before the Lord Almighty as they owe th eir existence to Him.
[GITA:13268] In verse 11.37, Arjuna uses the word Mahatma to a ddress the Lord. Sri
[GITA:13269] Rayaru in GV  refers to the scriptures and explains Mahatma as
[GITA:13270] mahat + atma  where mahat indicates completeness and atma has four
[GITA:13271] meanings – the one who spans the entire universe, the one who accepts
[GITA:13272] whatever is offered by devotees, the one who consumes the essence of
[GITA:13273] acceptable offerings, and the one who is eternal.

[GITA:13292] The Lord is everywhere, always full of infinite,  auspicious attributes. In

[GITA:13305] verse 11.39 , Arjuna describes the Lord as Vayu (form of strength and
[GITA:13306] wisdom), Yama (blemishless), Agni (activator of the inert Universe),
[GITA:13307] Varuna (accepts any offering from devotees), Chandra (full of bliss),
[GITA:13308] Prajapati (ruler of s ubjects) and Pitamaha (grandfather -father of Brahma
[GITA:13309] who himself is the father to all). He is indwelling in all these deities and He
[GITA:13310] powers their activities. The deities are in fact named after the Lord
[GITA:13311] indwelling in them as indicated by the meanings above.

[GITA:13319] (everything). (11.40)
[GITA:13321] Comments: In verse 11.39 , Arjuna describes the Lord’s form  as
[GITA:13322] intrinsically powering superior deities by the same name. Here Arjuna
[GITA:13323] extends that description to state that the Lord is everywhere and in
[GITA:13324] everything. He specifically addresses the Lord as ‘Sarva’ (one who  is
[GITA:13325] everywhere). Sri Rayaru in GV explains that the definition of ‘Sarva’ stated
[GITA:13326] by Arjuna unambiguously clarifies that the reference to ‘Sarva’ in
[GITA:13327] scriptures such as the Chandogya Upanishat  (3-14-1), the Taittireeya
[GITA:13328] (3-12) should be interpreted as referring to the Lord’s attribute of pervading
[GITA:13329] and spanning everywhere in the universe and should not be construed to
[GITA:13330] mean that the Lord Himself is the universe.

[GITA:13356] Without knowing Your greatness, thinking of You merely as my
[GITA:13357] friend, I have taken liberties and called You thus - Hey Krishna! Hey
[GITA:13358] Yadava! Hey, My Friend! - sometimes by mistake and sometimes in
[GITA:13359] affection. (11.41)
[GITA:13361] When relaxing, sleeping, sitting, and eating I have shown disrespect
[GITA:13362] by making fun of You. O Supreme One! You are full of infinite, auspicious
[GITA:13363] attributes. I beg You to forgive me. (11.42)
[GITA:13365] O Supreme Soul with Unending Abilities! You are the father of this
[GITA:13366] universe for both animate and inanimate objects. You are worthy of
[GITA:13367] worship by all. You are the greatest teache r. There is no one equal to You
[GITA:13368] in all three worlds. How can there be any one more superior? (11.43)
[GITA:13370] O Lord of Lords! As You are worthy of my worship, just like a
[GITA:13371] father is to a son, a friend to another friend, and a lover to a loved one,
[GITA:13372] please forgive all my mistakes. I beg You with all sincerity. (11.44)
[GITA:13374] Comments: In these verses, Arjuna expresses his remorse for taking
[GITA:13375] liberties when interacting with Krishna , being unaware of His greatness.
[GITA:13376] Normally when one is relaxing or sleeping, it is common for o ne to be in a
[GITA:13377] lighter mood. Arjuna is indicating to Krishna that during such light
[GITA:13378] moments he has treated Him as any other friend and might not have shown
[GITA:13379] Him proper respect. Arjuna is saying that his behaviour is partly due to his
[GITA:13380] ignorance about Krishna’ s greatness and partly due to his friendship.
[GITA:13381] Normally, when one addresses elders, teachers etc., one would not directly
[GITA:13382] call them by their name s, but would address them using respectful terms.

[GITA:13395] Arjuna has addressed the Lord as Friend, Yadava etc., and henc e is now
[GITA:13396] feeling remorseful. Arjuna begs Krishna to forgive him just as a father
[GITA:13397] would forgive a child, a friend would forgive a friend etc.

[GITA:13412] (11.46)
[GITA:13414] Comments: Arjuna states that he is overjoyed to have had t he
[GITA:13415] unique opportunity to view the Lord’s Universal Form. But at the same
[GITA:13416] time, he is frightened looking at the Lord’s threatening form even though
[GITA:13417] the purpose of that was  the destruction of evil forces. Arjuna is also
[GITA:13418] remorseful about his playful behaviour  with Krishna during their times
[GITA:13419] together. Arjuna now requests Krishna to appear again in  His prior form

[GITA:13446] The Lord said:  O Arjuna! As I Am pleased with you, I showed you

[GITA:13448] beginning or end. No one else has seen this form before. (11.47)
[GITA:13450] O Arjuna, Bravest A mong the Kurus! The Universal form that you
[GITA:13451] were able to see has not been visible to anyone in this world. One cannot
[GITA:13452] see this even if one has carried out elaborate sacrifices or practiced intense
[GITA:13453] austerities or made significant charitable donations or  undertaken deep
[GITA:13454] study of the scriptures. (11.48)
[GITA:13456] Do not be frightened and bewildered by seeing My terrifying
[GITA:13457] Universal form. Set aside your fears and put your mind at ease as I will
[GITA:13458] now appear in   the form which you have seen before. (11.49)
[GITA:13460] Comments: The Lord states that Arjuna was able to view His
[GITA:13461] Universal form because of his devotion and spir itual evolution. Sri Rayaru
[GITA:13462] in GV cautions that one should not literally interpret verses 11.47 and 11.48
[GITA:13463] to conclude that no one other than Arjuna has seen the Lor d’s Universal
[GITA:13464] Form. After all, in verses 11.20 and 11.23 , it was clearly stated that
[GITA:13465] everyone in the universe was terrified by looking at the Lord’s Universal
[GITA:13466] Form. Hence , the proper interpretation of 11.47 and 11.48  is that no one
[GITA:13467] would have seen the Lord  in the same way as Arjuna was able to see  Him.
[GITA:13468] This means that those who are less capable and hence have lesser eligibility
[GITA:13469] would have experienced the vision of Lord with much l esser precision and
[GITA:13470] clarity. Also, Sri Madhwacharya in GTN  with reference to the Brahmanda
[GITA:13471] Purana clarifies that superior deities such as Brahma and Rudra would
[GITA:13472] have viewed the Lord’s Universal Form with much higher precision and
[GITA:13484] 286                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:13485] clarity. Additionally, later in verse 11, 52, the Lord confirms that other
[GITA:13486] deities also would be viewing the Lord’s Universal Form just like Arjuna.

[GITA:13542] Comments: In 11.52 , the Lord states that it is exceedingly difficult
[GITA:13543] for one to get an opportunity to physically see Him. Even superior deities
[GITA:13544] are constantly striving to experience a vision of the Lord’s Universal Form.
[GITA:13545] Among those who can view the Lord, some deities such as Brahma, Rudra
[GITA:13546] etc., are able to see Him and experience joy. Others feel both joy and fear

[GITA:13548] happy and petrified looking at the Lord’s form. In 11.53, the Lord explains
[GITA:13549] the difficulty in getting an opportunity to view  His Universal form , saying
[GITA:13550] that even study of the Vedas, performing difficult penance, donating to
[GITA:13551] charity, or performing extensive ritual sacrifices cannot guarantee such an

[GITA:13561] undertaking difficult tasks to please Him as indicated in 11.53, how can one
[GITA:13562] obtain this vision of the Lord? This verse answers by stating that one needs
[GITA:13563] to surrender to Him with sincere, unconditional, unparalleled devotion to
[GITA:13575] 288                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:13576] experience a di rect vision of the Lord. The Lord uses the adjective
[GITA:13577] ‘ananya’ meaning unparalleled or incomparable to describe the path of
[GITA:13578] devotion. This implies that one should consider the path of devotion to be
[GITA:13579] superior to all other paths such as the path of knowledge,  the path of action,
[GITA:13580] donating to charity etc. This also means that these other paths are also
[GITA:13581] required for one to realize the Lord but are not sufficient in themselves.
[GITA:13582] They must be accompanied by single pointed devotion.
[GITA:13584] This verse has been recognized b y Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha in
[GITA:13585] BGS as summarizing this entire chapter. Reference to the word ‘ drashtum’
[GITA:13586] (to see) signifies the vision of the Lord’s Universal Form. This verse also
[GITA:13587] identifies unparalleled devotion as the way to experience divine vision.

[GITA:13603] Summary of Chapter 11
[GITA:13605] After listening to the Lord’s teachings on His divine manifestations,
[GITA:13606] His amazing activities in terms of creation of the universe etc., in  the
[GITA:13607] previous chapter, Arjuna is naturally curious to physically see the Lord’s
[GITA:13608] form. The Lord now exhibits His grand, Universal form which is the core
[GITA:13609] of this chapter termed Vishwa Roopa Darshana  (Vision of The Lord’s
[GITA:13621] Chapter 11                                                                                                                                          289
[GITA:13623] Universal Form). The Lord  empowers Arjuna with  divine vision as one
[GITA:13624] cannot view  Him with ordinary eyes (11.8). Arjun a views the Lord’ s
[GITA:13625] amazing, incredible, Universal Form spanning the entire universe with
[GITA:13626] countless heads, limbs etc. The descriptions of the Lord’s Universal Form
[GITA:13627] mirrors that in the Rig Vedic hymn, the Purusha Sookta. Arjuna describes
[GITA:13628] the grand sight and compares the Lord’s energy to that of thousands of
[GITA:13629] rising suns (11.12). He can see the entire universe sheltering inside the
[GITA:13630] Lord including all the deities starting from four faced Brahma (11.15). He
[GITA:13631] also sees many deities entering the Lord and praying to  the Lord with
[GITA:13632] utmost humility (11.21). Everyone is frightened on seeing the Lord’s
[GITA:13633] terrifying form. The Lord indicates in 11.32  that He (taking the name of
[GITA:13634] Kala) is about to perform the act of destroying the evil forces  who had
[GITA:13635] caused the rise of immorali ty in the world. This was the reason for His
[GITA:13636] frightening form. The Lord further tells Arjuna that He had already killed
[GITA:13637] all the leaders of the Kaurava army excepting  a few, thereby clearing
[GITA:13638] Arjuna’s doubts about winning the war. Waging the war is now a for mality
[GITA:13639] for Arjuna (11.33). Arjuna, after seeing the Lord’s form states that while he
[GITA:13640] feels blessed, he continues to be terrified and threatened by the Lord’s
[GITA:13641] frightening form. He is also remorseful that he ha s not treated Krishna with
[GITA:13642] proper respect as he was not fully aware of His greatness (11.41) and asks
[GITA:13643] for forgiveness (11.44). Arjuna also requests Krishna to appear again in His
[GITA:13644] earlier form that he was used to seeing (11.46). The Lord states that it is
[GITA:13645] exceedingly difficult for anyone to experience a direct vision of His
[GITA:13646] Universal Form. Even great deities strive extremely hard to experience
[GITA:13647] such a vision (11.52). Undertaking even difficult tasks such as diligent
[GITA:13648] study of the Vedas, performing difficult rituals, donating to charity etc.,
[GITA:13649] will not help o ne to experience such a direct vision, unless they are
[GITA:13650] accompanied by unparalleled, pure, unconditional devotion to the Lord
[GITA:13651] (11.54). The last few verses in this chapter act as a bridge to the next
[GITA:13652] chapter which focusses on the path of devotion.

[GITA:13669] Chapter 12 - The Path of Devotion
[GITA:13671] Chapter Introduction: This chapter of 20 verses is known as Bhakti
[GITA:13672] Yoga (The Path of Devotion). In chapter 10, the Lord described His special
[GITA:13673] presence in beings a nd objects which gave them superiority among peers ,
[GITA:13674] and in chapter 11 the Lord revealed His Universal Form to Arjuna to
[GITA:13675] convince him of His strength and powers. The Lord also states that it is
[GITA:13676] exceedingly difficult for one to behold a vision of His Universal Form and
[GITA:13677] Arjuna was indeed fortunate to have been granted that Divine Vision. In the
[GITA:13678] concluding verses of chapter 11, the Lord declares that sincere devotion
[GITA:13679] towards Him is the best way for a seeker to reach Him. This chapter
[GITA:13680] expands on the concept of d evotion and is hence termed the Path of
[GITA:13681] Devotion. In verse 7.23, it was stated that those who propitiate other deities
[GITA:13682] will achieve only temporary fruits and not everlasting bliss. However, in
[GITA:13683] the scriptures it is stated that the Lord’s consort Goddess Mahalakshmi who
[GITA:13684] is ever liberated is worshipped by all deities from Brahma onwards and that
[GITA:13685] she grants liberation to the eligible. A natural question that would arise is
[GITA:13686] about the effects of propitiating Goddess Lakshmi who is also known to
[GITA:13687] grant moksha to de votees. Arjuna (on behalf of other seekers) seeks
[GITA:13688] clarification on the benefits of propitiating Goddess Lakshmi who is the
[GITA:13689] governing deity for the principle of  the unmanifest ( avyakta). The Lord
[GITA:13690] responds to Arjuna’s questio n in verses 12.2 to 12.7  of this chapter and
[GITA:13691] concludes that worshipping Lord Narayana is an easier way to attain
[GITA:13692] moksha than pleasing Mahalakshmi. Further, Lakshmi operates under the
[GITA:13693] Lord Almighty’s control. One should propitiate Sri Lakshmi and other
[GITA:13694] deities as part of the Lord’s entoura ge for maximum effect. Bhakti or
[GITA:13695] devotion is focusing one ’s mind on the Lord. The Lord teaches us methods
[GITA:13696] of worshipping Him through action ( karma yoga ), through knowledge
[GITA:13697] (jnana yoga ), through meditation ( dhyana yoga ) and through devotion
[GITA:13698] (bhakti yoga ). T he last eight verses in this chapter describe the
[GITA:13699] characteristics of an ideal devotee who is dear to the Lord.

[GITA:13723] Mahalakshmi (also known as akshara, avyakta ), the imperishable,
[GITA:13724] unmanifest principle of divinity. Among these, which group ha s a better
[GITA:13725] understanding of the path to liberation? (12.1)
[GITA:13727] Comments: In chapter 7, verse 7.23 , the Lord clearly stated that
[GITA:13728] propitiating other deities will only yield temporary fruits and not the
[GITA:13729] permanent bliss experienced in moksha. In verse 11.55 , the Lord indicated
[GITA:13730] that one should consider Him the supreme entity and surrender to Him with
[GITA:13731] unconditional devotion to achieve liberation. However, in many instances
[GITA:13732] in the Vedas, it is clearly stated that Goddess Lakshmi also grants
[GITA:13733] liberation. Further, she i s superior to all other deities such as Brahma  and
[GITA:13734] Rudra and  is responsible for the crea tion of the universe. In verse 7.5 , it
[GITA:13735] was stated that Goddess Lakshmi controls all inert nature. She is superior to
[GITA:13736] all other deities as she is ever liberated and has an imperishable existence
[GITA:13737] (indicated by the adjective akshara in this verse). Given these facts, while
[GITA:13738] some seekers  focus exclusively on the Lord Almighty , others focus on
[GITA:13739] worshipping Goddess Lakshmi. A natural question one would have is about
[GITA:13740] the best path for the seeker, given that both the Lord (directly) and Goddess
[GITA:13741] Lakshmi (indirectly) are known to lead one to salvation.

[GITA:13760] The Lord said:  In My opinion, those seekers who worship Me with
[GITA:13761] supreme faith, and conduct their prescribed duties and meditation with the
[GITA:13762] mind immersed in Me, are superior. (12.2)
[GITA:13763] Comments: The Lord responds to Arjuna’s question in the following
[GITA:13764] six verses, 12.2 – 12.7. In this verse, He categorically states that those who
[GITA:13765] propitiate Him with supreme devotion have a better understanding of the
[GITA:13766] path to liberation compared to those who focus only on propitiating
[GITA:13767] Goddess Lakshmi, the imperishable, unmanifest principle. The Lord
[GITA:13768] provides detailed reasoning for this in the following verses.

[GITA:13812] Attaining the final goal of eternal bliss is exceedingly difficult for one

[GITA:13814] O Partha! One who surrenders all activities to Me, considering Me as
[GITA:13815] the Supreme One, worshipping Me with single minded devotion and
[GITA:13816] focusing the mind on Me will be able to cross the ocean of death bound
[GITA:13817] samsara, through My grace. (12.6) (12.7)
[GITA:13818] Comments: The Lord clarifies that achieving liberation by only
[GITA:13819] propitiating the unmanifest principle is exceedingly difficult. Sri
[GITA:13820] Madhwacharya in his GB states many reasons for this which are explained
[GITA:13821] by Sri Rayaru in GV.
[GITA:13823]  Goddess Lakshmi operates under the control of the Lord as stated in
[GITA:13824] 7.5, 15.17  and hence propitiating only her is an indirect path to
[GITA:13825] liberation.
[GITA:13826]  One must observe extremely strict measures in terms of controlling
[GITA:13827] one’s mind and senses, maintaining mental equanimit y etc., as any
[GITA:13828] dilution in these stipulations will hinder a seeker in obtaining
[GITA:13829] Goddess Lakshmi’s grace for achieving liberation. These stipulations
[GITA:13830] are detailed in verses 6.7, 6.8 etc.
[GITA:13831]  Propitiating the Lord is easier as He pardons devotees who are
[GITA:13832] unable to adhere strictly to stipulations in worship. The Lord will
[GITA:13844] 294                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:13845] ensure that such devotees will, in due course of time, overcome their
[GITA:13846] shortcomings (6.40).
[GITA:13847]  One who propitiates the Lord Almighty with the same effort that
[GITA:13848] would be spent in propitiating Goddess L akshmi will achieve
[GITA:13849] liberation sooner.
[GITA:13851] Sri Madhwacharya in GB  quotes passages from  the Sama Veda
[GITA:13852] (Madhuchhandasa and Ayasya branches) to support these interpretations.
[GITA:13853] Sri Vidyamanya Teertha in his GPM  states that those who only propitiate
[GITA:13854] Goddess Lakshmi may get distracted by the wealth that they may receive
[GITA:13855] from her which makes it very hard for such seekers to exert control over
[GITA:13856] their mind and senses.
[GITA:13858] In conclusion, worshipping the Lord directly is an easier way to attain
[GITA:13859] liberation compared to the indi rect way of pleasing the Lord through
[GITA:13860] Goddess Lakshmi. It must be noted that one must worship Goddess
[GITA:13861] Lakshmi and other deities such as Vayudeva, Rudra etc. also, but with a
[GITA:13862] conviction that all these deities are part of the Lord’s entourage. It should
[GITA:13863] also be noted that in the benedict ion of Gita Vivruti  [GV], Sri Rayaru
[GITA:13864] explicitly states – ‘Lakshmi Narayanam Natva ….’  which translates to – I
[GITA:13865] offer my obeisance to Goddess Lakshmi and Lord Narayana.

[GITA:13896] able to attain My abode in due course. Let there be no doubt about this .
[GITA:13897] (12.8)
[GITA:13899] O Dhananjaya! If you are unable to focus your mind on Me
[GITA:13900] singularly, with an intent on reaching Me as the ultimate goal, perform
[GITA:13901] repeated practice (abhyāsayogena) to focus your mind on Me. (12.9)
[GITA:13903] If repeated practice to focus your mind on Me is not possible, then
[GITA:13904] engage in activities that please Me (such as austerity, worship, service,
[GITA:13905] charity etc.), for My sake,  considering Me as supreme. Thereby yo u will
[GITA:13906] eventually attain Me. (12.10)
[GITA:13908] If it is not possible for one to perform activities such as intense
[GITA:13909] austerity, worship etc., then one should offer all their actions to Me with no
[GITA:13910] expectations.  (12.11)
[GITA:13912] Comments: After having established that the bes t path for a devotee
[GITA:13913] to attain liberation is by directly propitiating the Lord, a natural question
[GITA:13914] that would arise is about the best way to do that. In these four verses, the
[GITA:13915] Lord describes a progressive method for a devotee to worship Him with
[GITA:13916] singular m ental focus. In verse 12.8 , the Lord states the superiority of
[GITA:13917] meditation with mental concentration ( dhyana yoga ) as previously
[GITA:13918] described in Chapter 6. If one is not able to achieve this, then one should
[GITA:13919] try learning about the Lord through scriptural studi es ( jnana yoga -
[GITA:13920] paroksha). If these are not possible, a devotee should practice repeatedly to
[GITA:13921] achieve these  (12.9). If for some reason, one is not able to perform such
[GITA:13922] practice, then the Lord states in 12.10 , that the devotee should at least
[GITA:13923] engage in phy sical activities that would please Him (such as worshipping
[GITA:13935] 296                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:13936] Him with flowers, service, cha rity etc.) as these activities are not taxing on
[GITA:13937] the mind and intellect. For those who do not have deep conviction in the
[GITA:13938] Lord, but would rather focus on propitiating other deities, the Lord states in
[GITA:13939] 12.11 that such a devotee should at least perform this propitiation without
[GITA:13940] expectations and submit the fruits of such action to Him. In verse 7.22 , the
[GITA:13941] Lord states  that even those who propitiate other deities will receiv e their
[GITA:13942] rewards only through the Lord Himself.
[GITA:13943] Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha in his BGS identifies 12.8  as the core
[GITA:13944] verse in this chapter. Here the Lord has indicated that the best path for a
[GITA:13945] devotee to attain liberation is through direct propitiation of Him with
[GITA:13946] singular mental focus (meditation) on Him. Thus, this verse contains the
[GITA:13947] core principles of this chapter.

[GITA:13952] Acquiring proper knowledge is better than repe titions of actions

[GITA:13954] better than acqui sition of knowledge. Performing prescribed duties while
[GITA:13955] relinquishing fruits of action is better than mere  meditation. Such selfless
[GITA:13956] duties combined wit h deep medi tation on the Lord are the ways to attain
[GITA:13957] the Lord’s abode. (12.12)
[GITA:13958] Comments: The Lord concludes His discussion on the methods for a
[GITA:13959] devotee to achieve liberation in this verse by summarizing the various steps
[GITA:13960] involved in attaining moksha, and t he relative importa nce among such
[GITA:13961] steps. The final destination for every living being is to attain liberation
[GITA:13962] from bondage, a state where one would experience eternal bliss. The way to
[GITA:13963] attain moksha is by realizing direct vision and direct knowledge of the  Lord
[GITA:13964] (aparoksha jnana ). Such direct knowledge is achievable for one who is
[GITA:13965] immersed in meditation of the Lord with singular mental focus ( dhyana).
[GITA:13966] Such meditation is possible for someone who has learnt about the Lord
[GITA:13967] (indirectly through stud y of scripture s, teachings from a Guru etc. –
[GITA:13968] paroksha jnana ). One must repeatedly practice medi tation and scriptural
[GITA:13980] Chapter 12                                                                                                                                       297
[GITA:13982] studies to obtain an understanding of the Lord. One will be able to focus
[GITA:13983] ones minds on meditation and scriptural studies , if one involves oneself in
[GITA:13984] activities that please Him (such as worshipping the Lord, service to society,
[GITA:13985] charity etc.).

[GITA:14003] Comments: In the following verses, the Lord identifies the
[GITA:14004] characteristics of an ideal devotee who is dear to  Him. Many of these
[GITA:14005] characteristics appeared in previous chapters such as 2.55 – 2.61, 4.22, 5.18
[GITA:14006] to 5.21, 6.7 to 6.9 .  The Lord had also stated the natu re of a devotee dear to
[GITA:14007] Him in 7.17 . All these characteristics are now consolidated in one place  in
[GITA:14008] the following eight verses 12.13 to 12.20.
[GITA:14010] In verse 12.13, the Lord describes the cha racteristics of a compassionate
[GITA:14011] devotee as one who
[GITA:14012]  Has no enmity towards anyone
[GITA:14013]  Anticipates distress and protects friends from it
[GITA:14025] 298                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita

[GITA:14076] describe a devotee who avoids unnecessary activities. Sri Rayaru [GV]
[GITA:14077] describes the  four actions to be avoided by such  a devotee. They are –
[GITA:14078] (i) activities not dear to the Lord, (ii) performing activities with ego,
[GITA:14079] (iii) performing activities with expectation on the rewards, and (iv) not
[GITA:14080] submitting all activities to the Lord. Such  a devotee is indeed very dear to

[GITA:14092] devotee. This verse clarifies that such characteristics  should always be

[GITA:14094] declaring that His devotees should avoid both auspicious ( shubha) and
[GITA:14095] inauspicious (ashubha) activities. The implication is that one should avoid
[GITA:14096] even auspicious act ivities (such as performing rituals for temporary
[GITA:14097] rewards) if they end up in entangling a devotee. One should only aspire  for
[GITA:14098] divine knowledge,  detachment (to wards worldly matters) and devotion to
[GITA:14099] the Lord.

[GITA:14134] The methods indicated here are the ways to worship the Lord
[GITA:14135] Almighty and achieve liberation. The Lord states that one who observes
[GITA:14136] these methods sincerely, with deep faith and  devotion in Him, is indeed
[GITA:14137] very dear to Him. (12.20)
[GITA:14139] Comments: Any devotee who has any of these chara cteristics
[GITA:14140] described in verses 12.13 to 12.19  is dear to the Lord. Hence, a devotee
[GITA:14141] who has all these identified characteristics i s indeed extremely dear  to the
[GITA:14142] Lord and will easily reach Him.
[GITA:14144] Summary of Chapter 12
[GITA:14146] In chapter 10, the Lord described His divine presence in beings and
[GITA:14147] objects which give them superiority among their peers , and in chapter 11,
[GITA:14148] the Lord revealed His Universal Form to Arjuna to convince him of His
[GITA:14149] strength and powers. The Lord also state d that it is exceedingly difficult for
[GITA:14150] one to achieve the vision of His Universal Form and that Arjuna was
[GITA:14162] Chapter 12                                                                                                                                       301
[GITA:14164] indeed fortunate to have been granted that Divine Vision. In the concluding
[GITA:14165] verses of cha pter 11, the Lord declares that sincere devotion towards Him
[GITA:14166] is the best way for a seeker to reach Him. This chapter expands on the
[GITA:14167] concept of devotion and is hence termed the Path of Devotion.
[GITA:14169] In verse 7.23, it was stated that those who propitiate other deities will
[GITA:14170] achieve only temporary fruits and not  everlasting bliss. However, in the
[GITA:14171] scriptures it is stated that the Lord’s consort, Goddess Mahalakshmi who is
[GITA:14172] ever liberated is worshipped by all deities from Brahma onwards and she
[GITA:14173] grants liberation to the eligible. A natural question that would arise is about
[GITA:14174] the effects of propitiating Goddess Lakshmi who is also known to grant
[GITA:14175] moksha to devotees. Arjuna (on behalf of other seekers) seeks clarification
[GITA:14176] on the benefits of propitiating Goddess Lakshmi wh o is the governing deity
[GITA:14177] for the principle of the unmanifest ( avyakta). The Lord responds to
[GITA:14178] Arjuna’s question in verses 12.2 to 12.7  of this chapter and concludes that
[GITA:14179] worshipping Lord Almighty Narayana is an easier way to attain moksha
[GITA:14180] and pleasing Mahalakshmi is difficult. Further, Lakshmi operates under the
[GITA:14181] Lord’s control. One should propitiate Goddess Lakshmi and other deities as
[GITA:14182] part of the Lord’s entourage for maximum benefit.
[GITA:14184] Bhakti or devotion is focusing one ’s mind on the Lord. In verses
[GITA:14185] 12.8 – 12.12, The Lord teaches Arjuna the methods of expressing devotion
[GITA:14186] using facilities such as intellect, studying, performing prescribed duties etc.
[GITA:14187] The last eight verses in this chapter describe the characteristics of an ideal
[GITA:14188] devotee who is dear to the Lor d. Many of these characteristics were stated
[GITA:14189] in previous chapters and are consolidated here in a unified manner for easy
[GITA:14190] reference.

[GITA:14208] Chapter 13 - The Field and The Knower of the Field
[GITA:14210] Chapter Introduction: This chapter of 35 verses is termed Kshetra
[GITA:14211] Kshetrajna Yoga (The Field and the Knower  of the Field).  As indicated in
[GITA:14212] the introductory chapter, Sri Rayaru  in GV  has provided an excellent
[GITA:14213] categorization of the 18 chapters in Gita by dividing them into 3 groups of
[GITA:14214] 6 chapters each. Chapters 7 -12 dealt primarily with the topic of the Lord’s
[GITA:14215] attributes and greatness as seen in Chapter 10 (The Lord’s Divine
[GITA:14216] Manifestations), Chapter 11 (The Lord’s Universal Form) etc. After all, the
[GITA:14217] goal of  every living being is to realize the Lord to achieve liberation.
[GITA:14218] Chapters 1-6 discussed the various means for one to realize the Lord, such
[GITA:14219] as the path of knowledge, the path of action, the path of devotion etc. The se
[GITA:14220] last six chapters  (Chapter 13 to 18)  expand on some of the important
[GITA:14221] concepts covered in the previous chapters. In chapter 2, verses 2 -12
[GITA:14222] onwards, the attributes of individual souls were described. In chapters 10,
[GITA:14223] 11, 12 etc., the Lord’s forms, attributes and grea tness were discussed. In
[GITA:14224] verse 7.4 , the attributes of eightfold  inert nature were discussed. Arjuna
[GITA:14225] now wants to understand more about the interrelationships between the
[GITA:14226] three entities – the Lord Almighty, individual souls, and inert  nature. The
[GITA:14227] Lord responds to Arjuna’s questions on the entities in verses 13.2 to 13.24 .
[GITA:14228] The interrelationship s between these three entities form the philosophical
[GITA:14229] basis for the principle of fivefold differences (pancha bheda).

[GITA:14237] Arjuna said:  O Keshava! I would like to know more about – inert
[GITA:14238] nature, the individual, the field of activity, the knower of the field of
[GITA:14239] activity, knowledge, and the object of knowledge. (13.1)
[GITA:14251] Chapter 13                                                                                                                                     303
[GITA:14253] Comments: Arjuna requests details on the following six topics –
[GITA:14254] prakruti (inert nature) and purusha (individual soul), kshetra (field of
[GITA:14255] activity) and kshetrajna (one who fully knows about kshetra), jnana
[GITA:14256] (knowledge and prerequisites to obtain knowledge) and jneya (the one who
[GITA:14257] is to be known). In verses 13.2 to 13.7 , the Lord provides details on kshetra
[GITA:14258] and kshetrajna and verses 13.8 to 13.19 cover the topics of jnana and jneya.
[GITA:14259] Verses 13.20 to 13.24  are related to prakruti and purusha. The remaining
[GITA:14260] verses describe the interaction and interrelationships among these entities.
[GITA:14262] The word purusha can refer to both the individual soul ( jeevatma)
[GITA:14263] and the Lord Almighty (paramatma) based on the context of its use, as seen
[GITA:14264] from verses 13.22 where it refers to the individ ual soul and 13.23 , where it
[GITA:14265] refers to the Lord. Sri Rayaru in GV  clarifies that the wor d purusha in this
[GITA:14266] verse refers to the individual soul. Also, the word jnana which ordinarily
[GITA:14267] refers to knowledge should be taken to mean the method to obtain
[GITA:14268] knowledge. This will be evident from  the Lord’s response in verses 13.8 to
[GITA:14269] 13.12, where the Lord identifies 20 different characteristics needed to
[GITA:14270] obtain knowledge.

[GITA:14278] of this field of activity is the knower. (13.2)
[GITA:14280] Comments: The Lord uses the word shareera (physical body) to
[GITA:14281] identify the entity that forms kshetra (the field of activity) , based of word
[GITA:14282] derivation. Here, shareera = shar (the entity subject to feelings) + eera (the
[GITA:14283] entity owing its existence to the Lord). The knower of the field of activity
[GITA:14284] is termed kshetrajna, the o ne who knows kshetra which is derived from
[GITA:14285] ksheeyate (the entity with indwelling Lord Almighty).

[GITA:14308] Comments: Since the physical body ( kshetra) belongs to a living
[GITA:14309] being, can that living being be called kshetrajna (knower of the field of
[GITA:14310] activity)? No. The Lord clarifies by emphatically stating that He is the
[GITA:14311] knower of the field of activity. Further, Vishnu Sahasra Nama , verse 2
[GITA:14312] identifies kshetrajna as one of the names of the Lord. Also, by using the
[GITA:14313] qualifier sarva (all) before the term kshetra, it is clarified that the universe
[GITA:14314] of inert nature also comes under the definition of field of activity.

[GITA:14350] Comments: The Lord states th at the concepts described in His
[GITA:14351] teachings have been well known , based on  proclamations from various

[GITA:14361] The field of activity is comprised of the following - the five basic
[GITA:14362] elements of nature (earth, water, fire, spa ce, air), principles of
[GITA:14363] individuation, consciousness, intellect and the three qualities of nature
[GITA:14364] which comprise the unmanifest. Along with these , there are eleven sense
[GITA:14365] organs (five organs of perception, five organs of action and mind), five
[GITA:14366] objects of the sense organs ( form, smell, sound, taste, touch), emotions of
[GITA:14367] desire, disdain, pleasure, pain, the physical body, mental propensity, and
[GITA:14368] determination (all these entities have governing deities). (13.6) (13.7)
[GITA:14370] Comments: The Lord describes the composition  of the field of
[GITA:14371] activity. It contains both physically observable elements such as the five
[GITA:14372] basic elements of nature, inner faculties, and qualities/attributes. All these
[GITA:14373] make up a personality. The unmanifest entity is comprised of the three
[GITA:14374] qualities of n ature, namely, sattv (pious), rajas (passion), and tamas
[GITA:14375] (ignorance). The principle of intellect is one of the four inner faculties ,
[GITA:14376] which are mind ( manas), intellect ( buddhi), individuation (ahankara), and
[GITA:14377] memory ( chitta). The mind causes confusion, and the intellect helps in
[GITA:14378] discrimination.
[GITA:14391] 306                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:14392] In verse 13.34 , the Lord had also indicated that He would describe
[GITA:14393] the entities that govern the components of the field of activity. They are
[GITA:14394] governed by deities who cause the entities to act. The deities who control
[GITA:14395] the components of the field of activity are described by Sri Rayaru in GV
[GITA:14396] as follows -
[GITA:14398] (i) The five basic elements of nature: space (Ganap athy), air
[GITA:14399] (Mareechi), fire (Vahni), water (Varuna), and earth (Dhara Devi)
[GITA:14400] (ii) The four cosmic principles: avyakta - unmanifest (Lakshmi),
[GITA:14401] mahat – cosmic intelligence (Brahma), ahankara - individuation (Rudra),
[GITA:14402] buddhi - intellect (Parvati)
[GITA:14403] (iii) The mind (Skanda, Indra, Aniruddha – son of Kama)
[GITA:14404] (iv) 5 sense organs of perception): ear (Moon), skin (Marut), eyes
[GITA:14405] (Sun), tongue (Varuna), nose (Ashwini twins)
[GITA:14406] (v) 5 sense organs of action: voice (Agni), hands (Maruts), Feet
[GITA:14407] (Yagna, Shambhu), excretory organs (Yama), organs of reproduction
[GITA:14408] (Shiva, Manu)
[GITA:14409] (vi) 5 objects of sense organs: sound, touch, form, taste, smell
[GITA:14410] (five  children of Shiva)
[GITA:14412] The above 25 principles result in the ef fects of emotions indicated in
[GITA:14413] 13.7. The governing entities for these effects are:  Desire (Sreedevi and
[GITA:14414] Bharatidevi), disdain (Kali), sadness (Dwapara), happiness (Mukhya
[GITA:14415] Vayu), determination and boldness (Saraswati, Bharati), mental propensity
[GITA:14416] (Sreedevi), physical Body (other deities)
[GITA:14417] The relative gradations o f these governing deiti es were alluded to in
[GITA:14418] verse 3.42 . All these deities operate under the control of the Lord as
[GITA:14419] indicated previously in verse 3.43.
[GITA:14420] A note on the principles of mahat and buddhi: Many times, the term
[GITA:14421] buddhi is used to refer to both mahat and buddhi. However, mahat and
[GITA:14422] buddhi are different principles with mahat referring to cosmic intelligence
[GITA:14434] Chapter 13                                                                                                                                     307
[GITA:14436] and buddhi referring to normal intelligence. In that sense, mahat, whose
[GITA:14437] governing deity is Brahma , is responsible for special, divine knowledge
[GITA:14438] (vijnana - aparoksha), and buddhi whose governing deity is Parvati is
[GITA:14439] responsible for acquired knowledge ( jnana - paroksha). The concepts of
[GITA:14440] jnana and vijnana were covered in Chapter 7. Also, many principles have
[GITA:14441] multiple governing deities, with one primary governing deity and one or
[GITA:14442] more secondary deities. In all cases, the Lord is the controlling deity.

[GITA:14461] detachment from sense pleasures, absence of ego, awareness of birth, death,
[GITA:14462] old age and diseases, no n-attachment to possessions, equipoise during gain
[GITA:14463] and pai n, deep single-minded devotion in Me (Krishna), keeping aloof,

[GITA:14477] attributes comprise knowledge and are the means to achieve knowledge.
[GITA:14478] Anything contrary to these constitutes ignorance. (13.8 ) (13.9) (13.10)
[GITA:14479] (13.11) (13.12)
[GITA:14481] Comments: From verse 13.3 onwards, the Lord provide s details about
[GITA:14482] the entity ( the Lord ) that stimulates and powers the components of the
[GITA:14483] field of activity. To understand the attributes and nature of that entity, it is
[GITA:14484] important for a seeker to have  requisite mental and physical discipline.
[GITA:14485] These are represented by the 20 attributes of an enlightened person
[GITA:14486] identified in these 5 verses and they form the path or procedure or ways
[GITA:14487] (sadhana) for one to understand the Lord. An ideal seeker is one who:
[GITA:14489] 1. is humble
[GITA:14490] 2. is unpretentious
[GITA:14491] 3. practices non-violence
[GITA:14492] 4. is tolerant
[GITA:14493] 5. is sincere in action (physical, vocal, mental)
[GITA:14494] 6. respects and serves teachers and scholars

[GITA:14530] Now I will describe that principle which is to be known (the object
[GITA:14531] of knowledge), knowing which one will attain the nectar of i mmortality.
[GITA:14532] That object is the Supreme Lord who has no beginning and is eternal. This
[GITA:14533] principle is distinct from entities that have form  (sat) and those that are
[GITA:14534] formless (asat). (13.13)
[GITA:14536] Comments: Lord Krishna clarifies that He is the object of
[GITA:14537] knowledge and hence is termed jneya (the one to be known). The Lord
[GITA:14538] identifies Himself as jneya but uses the qualifier anadi matparam (the one
[GITA:14539] who has no beginning and who is Supreme) as in ve rse 8.3. Of course, in
[GITA:14540] verse 7.7 etc., He already declared that there is no one superior to Him, and
[GITA:14541] hence there is no need to repeat  that attribute. Sri Rayaru in GV  clarifies
[GITA:14542] that the Lord is distinct from entities that have form and those that are
[GITA:14543] formless. The entities that have form are the three basic elements of nature
[GITA:14544] (earth, water, fire) and those that are formless are the two remaining basic
[GITA:14545] elements of nature (air, space). This is a way of indicating that the Lord is
[GITA:14546] above and beyond the influence of nature.

[GITA:14555] Comments: If the Lord is different both from entities with form and

[GITA:14582] Comments: The Lord continues His description of the object of
[GITA:14583] knowledge. While 13.14  dealt with the Lord’s form, this verse is about the
[GITA:14584] Lord’s attributes and seems to imply antithetical qualities. Sri Rayaru in
[GITA:14585] GV provides rationalization for these seemingly contradictory descriptions.
[GITA:14586] The Lord not having sense organs is referring to Him not hav ing sense
[GITA:14587] organs made of material nature as His organs are transcendental in nature.
[GITA:14588] Similarly, while He consumes the positive essence of all activities, He is
[GITA:14589] not bound by actions. And He is devoid of attributes as He is beyond the
[GITA:14590] three attributes of nat ure ( sat, rajas, tamas ). He is full of infinite,

[GITA:14631] having undivided form , with multiple incarnations of the same form with
[GITA:14632] no difference. Ignorant ones consider these as different.

[GITA:14647] In verse 13.16 , it was stated that the Lord exists both inside and outside of
[GITA:14648] living beings. In this verse, it is clarified that the Lord reside s inside every
[GITA:14649] living being within the heart (hrudi). Sri Rayaru in GV  quotes the Brahma

[GITA:14673] Comments: The Lord concludes His sermon on the topics that

[GITA:14675] kshetrajna (one who fully knows about kshetra), but d oes not explicitly
[GITA:14676] indicate kshetrajna here, as it is included in jneya. Verses 13.2 to 13.7 ,
[GITA:14677] covered the details o f kshetra and kshetrajna and verses 13.8 to 13.19
[GITA:14678] covered the topics of jnana and jneya. The word jnana is used to mean both
[GITA:14679] knowledge and the prerequisites for knowledge an d these were covered i n
[GITA:14680] verses 13 -8 to 13 -11, and verse 13.12  respectively. The Lord also states
[GITA:14681] that His devotees who properly understand and live by these principles will
[GITA:14682] reach Him. It must be note d that mere scholarship on these topics is not
[GITA:14683] enough for one to reach the Lord . They must be incorporated in a seeker’s
[GITA:14684] life. Such a person is indeed a true devotee of the Lord.

[GITA:14694] Comments: In the next five verses 13.20 – 13.24, the Lord answers
[GITA:14695] Arjuna’s question from verse 13.1 regarding prakruti (nature) and purusha
[GITA:14707] Chapter 13                                                                                                                                     313
[GITA:14709] (being). Prakruti can mean both insentient nature and sentient nature.
[GITA:14710] Likewise, purusha can mean both the individual soul and the Supreme Soul
[GITA:14711] (Lord Almighty). The appropriate interpretation depends on the context in
[GITA:14712] which these words are used. Verse 13.6 describes  prakruti (nature), and
[GITA:14713] verse 13.7 describes its transformations. These constitute the physical body
[GITA:14714] and personality of purusha (the living being – individual soul). Both nature
[GITA:14715] and individual souls have no beginning and have always existed.

[GITA:14720] Creation of an individual’s physical body and sense organs is
[GITA:14721] performed by sentient nature (Goddess Mahalakshmi) , and the experience
[GITA:14722] of emotions by an individual is due to the Lord. (13.21)
[GITA:14724] Comments: This v erse describes the interaction between the
[GITA:14725] individual soul, nature (inert and sentient) and the Lord .  Again, as stated in
[GITA:14726] the comments o n the previous verse, prakruti can mean both inert nature
[GITA:14727] and sentient nature and, purusha can mean both individual sou l and the
[GITA:14728] supreme soul (Lord Almight y). Accordingly, Sri Rayaru in GV  provides
[GITA:14729] two interesting interpretations.
[GITA:14731] While the Lord Almighty is primarily responsible for the creation of
[GITA:14732] living beings and for the experience of their emotions, Goddess Lakshmi
[GITA:14733] also has a role to play. She has a higher role in creation as compared to
[GITA:14734] consumption or experiencing happiness or sadness by living beings. Hence,
[GITA:14735] she is indicated as the cause for the creation of living beings.
[GITA:14737] Alternately, this verse can also be interpr eted to mean as follows.
[GITA:14738] Inert nature is the material cause in the physical creation of living beings ,
[GITA:14739] and living beings consume or experience emotions such as happiness  and
[GITA:14740] sadness.

[GITA:14758] It is well known that the individual soul residing in the body,
[GITA:14759] comprised of the elements of nature, experiences emotions through contact
[GITA:14760] with the three attributes of nature. It is then reborn in pious or unholy
[GITA:14761] families depending on the level of attachment with such emotions. (13.22)
[GITA:14763] Comments: The use of the letter ‘ hi’ in the first line indicates that
[GITA:14764] the impact s of the elements of nature on the emotions experienced by a
[GITA:14765] living being are known through experience. An individual exp eriences
[GITA:14766] emotion such as happiness or sadness due to the impact of the attributes of
[GITA:14767] nature such as sattv, rajas and tamas. Excessive attachment to such
[GITA:14768] emotions will entangle an individual. For example, individuals who
[GITA:14769] experience happiness may focus exclu sively on accumulating worldly
[GITA:14770] riches to ensure everlasting happiness , which prevents them from
[GITA:14771] performing activities that please the Lord. Their actions impact the
[GITA:14772] circumstances of their succeeding births.

[GITA:14779] consumes the fruits of all activities, and He is omnipotent. (13.23)
[GITA:14781] Comments: Verse 13.4 raises many questions on the field of
[GITA:14782] activity, the knower etc. One of the questions was about the entity who
[GITA:14783] governs the field of activity. The Lord answers this question by stating that
[GITA:14784] He is the entity that governs all activit ies in all beings, and He is also the
[GITA:14785] consumer of all these activities. The previous verse 13.22 indicated that
[GITA:14786] interactions with the effects of the qualities of nature determine the future
[GITA:14787] birth of an individual. This verse clarifies that the qualities of  nature are
[GITA:14788] material causes and the instrumental cause is the Lord. As stated in
[GITA:14800] Chapter 13                                                                                                                                     315
[GITA:14802] comments to verse 13.20 , the word purusha can refer to either a living
[GITA:14803] being, or the Lord Almighty and the appropriate interpretation depends on
[GITA:14804] the context. In this verse, purusha refers to the Lord due to the use of the
[GITA:14805] adjective para (supreme).

[GITA:14854] Comments: Since one needs to ex perience a direct vision of the
[GITA:14855] Lord to attain divine, spiritual knowledge, this verse identifies the different
[GITA:14856] paths taken by seekers in their spiritual journey. Some visualize the Lord
[GITA:14857] through concentrated meditation ( dhyana). Some visualize the Lord
[GITA:14858] through intense study, contemplation, and analysis of scriptures  (jnana).
[GITA:14859] Some visualize the Lord through performance of prescribed duties without
[GITA:14860] expectations (karma).
[GITA:14862] Sri Rayaru in GV quotes Sri Madhwacharya’s GTN  for a second
[GITA:14863] interpretation of this verse . Some sages visualize the Lord in their hearts
[GITA:14864] through meditation and through their innate talent ( pratibha) of novel
[GITA:14865] interpretations of scriptures. Deities , through their innate talent of
[GITA:14866] discovering newer interpretations of scriptures , can visualize the  Lord
[GITA:14867] without a need for vocal instruction from their superiors. Some who are
[GITA:14868] superior among  rulers perform their prescribed duties such as protecting
[GITA:14869] their citizens during attac k from enemies  and performance of sacrifices
[GITA:14870] (such as Ashwamedha). They visual ize the Lord who appears before them
[GITA:14871] to consume their offerings during such sacrifices.
[GITA:14873] Verse 13.26 addresses the situation of those who are not as talent ed
[GITA:14874] as the deities indicated in 13.25 . Such seekers also benefit greatly from
[GITA:14875] learning about the Lord through vocal instructions from their teachers and
[GITA:14876] can ultimately cross the ocean of worldly miseries. This indicates the power
[GITA:14877] of shravana or vocal instruction. Deities starting from Brahma have
[GITA:14878] gradations in not only their physical form but also in their innate talent. For
[GITA:14879] example, Lord Brahma and Lord Vayudeva are endowed with 32 superior
[GITA:14880] qualities in their physical form. Other deities have lesser superior qualities
[GITA:14881] in their physical form s. Likewise, Lord Brahma  and Vayu have the highest

[GITA:14895] innate talent ( pratibha) among all living beings and can visualize and
[GITA:14896] meditate on the Lord without any explicit vocal instruction. But it is
[GITA:14897] observed that even these great deities are often listening to Vedic teachings
[GITA:14898] from the Lord. They do this as a respect to the Lord to earn His grace and

[GITA:14906] O Superior among the Bharatas! Know that all entities in the
[GITA:14907] universe, movable and immovable, are created out of the union of sentient
[GITA:14908] nature and the Lord Almighty. (13.27)
[GITA:14910] Comments: The Lord continues t o answer the question posed in
[GITA:14911] 13.27 regarding the field of activity, its origins, its transforma tions etc. This
[GITA:14912] verse describes the process of creation of living beings. The union of
[GITA:14913] kshetrajna (the Lord Almighty) and kshetra (the sentient nature embodied
[GITA:14914] by Goddess Lakshmi) results in the creation of all entities in the universe.
[GITA:14915] The word kshetra which was previously interpreted to mean the physical
[GITA:14916] body of living beings can also be interpreted to mean Goddess Lakshmi. It
[GITA:14917] should be noted that in a later verse 14.3 , the Lord explicitly indicates that
[GITA:14918] He and His consort are responsible for the creation of all living beings.

[GITA:14940] The same Lord Almi ghty resides in all beings. Even when these
[GITA:14941] living beings perish, the Lord continues existence as He is imperishable.
[GITA:14942] The one who knows this is indeed knowledgeable. (13.28)
[GITA:14944] One who knows the Lord as being defectless, full of infinite
[GITA:14945] auspicious attribute s, and residing in equal measure in all , will never lose
[GITA:14946] knowledge and will never experience downfall. Such a person will be on
[GITA:14947] the right path (13.29)
[GITA:14949] Comments: In verse 13.3, the Lord indicates  that He resides in all
[GITA:14950] beings as kshetrajna. However, living beings experience different emotions
[GITA:14951] such as happiness and sadness in varying proportions. These verses explain
[GITA:14952] that regardless of the differing experiences in different living beings, the
[GITA:14953] Lord exists unifor mly in everyone. Sri Rayaru in GV  quotes the Brahma
[GITA:14954] Sutra (3.2.11) which states that the Lord who exists in different places and
[GITA:14955] in different beings has no difference among His forms.

[GITA:14962] who is aware of this dependency on the Lord is truly knowledgeable.
[GITA:14963] (13.30)
[GITA:14964] Comments: This verse clarifies that the difference in birth situati ons
[GITA:14965] experienced by living beings is primarily due to their differing innate
[GITA:14966] natures (and resulting activities) and not due to any partiality on the p art of
[GITA:14967] the Lord. Sri Rayaru in GV  quotes the Brahma Sutra (2.1.35) to support
[GITA:14968] the argument that the Lord does not exhibit partiality towards anyone.
[GITA:14970] This verse also describes the doership of activities perform ed by
[GITA:14971] living beings. Rayaru in GV  provides two interpretations for this verse
[GITA:14972] based on the phrase ‘ atmanam akartaram’. It was stated previously in
[GITA:14984] Chapter 13                                                                                                                                     319
[GITA:14986] comments on verse 6.5 , that the word ‘ atma’ has many meanings and the
[GITA:14987] two meanings applicable here are – individual soul and Supreme Soul
[GITA:14988] (Lord Almighty). With these two meanings, the phrase ‘ atmanam
[GITA:14989] akartaram’ can be interpreted as follows  - Ones who are consi dered truly
[GITA:14990] knowledgeable are aware that -
[GITA:14992] (i) the Lord who activates the individual beings to perform their
[GITA:14993] activities is Himself not activated by anyone else (akartaram)
[GITA:14995] (ii) living beings cannot perform any activities independently
[GITA:14996] (akartaram)
[GITA:14998] This important verse is identified by Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha in
[GITA:14999] his BGS as comprising the core concepts in this chapter.

[GITA:15008] Comments: The Lord not only activates all living beings, He is also
[GITA:15009] the supporter of multitudes of living beings and in that sense, they are said
[GITA:15010] to exist inside Him . Sri Rayaru explains in GV  that the use of the qualifier
[GITA:15011] ‘pritak’ (different) when describing various living organisms ( bhootanam),
[GITA:15012] refers to the varying nature of individual souls ( jiva-jiva bheda ) which is
[GITA:15013] one of the essentia l features of the pancha bheda (the fivefold differences)
[GITA:15014] principle. This will be explained at the end of this chapter.

[GITA:15031] He is imperishable. Hence the Lord, even thoug h existing inside an
[GITA:15032] individual will not be impacted by the defects of that individual. The
[GITA:15033] activities of individuals do not taint the Lord. (13.32)
[GITA:15034] Summary: The previous verse alluded to the difference s amongst
[GITA:15035] individual souls and between individual soul s and the Lord. This verse
[GITA:15036] purports to answer many questions that may arise from superficial
[GITA:15037] interpretations in scriptures that seem to indicate identity among individual
[GITA:15038] souls and the Lord. Sri Rayaru in GV quotes Sri Madhwacharya’s GTN and
[GITA:15039] advances five arguments to illustrate the difference between individual
[GITA:15040] souls and the Lord.
[GITA:15042] 1. This verse uses the word ‘ shareerastha’ to refer to individual souls
[GITA:15043] who have physical bodies comprised of the elements of nature and
[GITA:15044] are subject to birth. The Lord is referred to as ‘ anadi’ (birthless).
[GITA:15045] This concept was described in 10.3.
[GITA:15046] 2. Individual souls are influenced by the three qualities of nature ( guna)
[GITA:15047] as indicated in verses 13.20 to 13.22. The Lord is referred to as
[GITA:15048] ‘nirguna’ (the one beyond the three qualities of nature). This concept
[GITA:15049] is discussed in 7.13 and 14.19.
[GITA:15050] 3. This verse uses the word ‘ shareerastha’ to refer to individual souls
[GITA:15051] who have physical bodies comprised of the elements of nature and
[GITA:15052] hence are subject to decay and death. The Lord is referred to as
[GITA:15053] ‘avyaya’ (imperishable). This conce pt was discussed previously in
[GITA:15054] 2.17.
[GITA:15055] 4. The Lord independently causes the activities of individual souls who
[GITA:15056] by themselves cannot perform any activity. The Lord’s activities are
[GITA:15057] not with any expectations as indicated by the phrase ‘ na karoti’. The
[GITA:15058] Lord has no obligation  to perform any activities.  This concept was
[GITA:15059] indicated in 3.22.
[GITA:15060] 5. Even though the Lord is the cause of activities in everyone, He
[GITA:15061] Himself is not tainted by the actions of individual souls as indicated
[GITA:15073] Chapter 13                                                                                                                                     321
[GITA:15075] by the phrase ‘na lipyate’. This was also indicated in verses 4.14, 9.9
[GITA:15076] and 13.30.

[GITA:15081] Just as space that pervades everywhere and touches everything  is not
[GITA:15082] tainted by anything, the Lord li kewise is pervading everywhere and in
[GITA:15083] everyone, but is never tainted. (13.33)
[GITA:15085] Comments: This verse provides an example to illustrate the concept
[GITA:15086] of the Lord not getting tainted by anyone’s activities which was addressed
[GITA:15087] in the previous verse. Space exists  everywhere, in the minutest of objects
[GITA:15088] and outside in the entire universe. However, it does not take on the
[GITA:15089] attributes of those objects. Likewise, the Lord who resides in every being is
[GITA:15090] not impacted by the attributes and activities of these beings. A simi lar
[GITA:15091] example was employed previously in verse 9.6.

[GITA:15099] the Lord’s infinite energy and radiance. There is only one Sun that
[GITA:15100] illuminates our entire world, and likewise there is only one Lord Almighty
[GITA:15101] who illuminates, powers, and acti vates the entire universe and its

[GITA:15121] One who can, through the eyes of knowledge, clearly understand the
[GITA:15122] difference between the field of  activity, the knower of the field of activity
[GITA:15123] and the method to achieve liberation from nature’s bondage, will surely
[GITA:15124] attain the Lord’s abode. (13.35)
[GITA:15126] Comments: The Lord concludes His teachings in this chapter by
[GITA:15127] summarizing that one , who by following th e methods in 13.8 to 13.12  can
[GITA:15128] attain proper knowledge about the field of activity and the knower of
[GITA:15129] activity, and the differences between them will indeed attain the Lord
[GITA:15130] whose special attributes and differences from individual souls and inert
[GITA:15131] objects were identified in various verses such as 13.32 to 13.34 . This verse
[GITA:15132] uses the term antaram (difference) to indicate the difference between
[GITA:15133] kshetra (living beings and nature) and the kshetrajna (the Lord Almighty).
[GITA:15135] The relationship between the three entities in the universe, namely
[GITA:15136] individual souls, inert nature, and the Lord Almighty described in this
[GITA:15137] chapter can be viewed as an explanation for the concept of fivefold
[GITA:15138] differences (pancha bheda), which is one of the foundational principles of
[GITA:15139] the philosophy of Sri Madhwacharya. The fivefold difference s among – (i)
[GITA:15140] inert objects, (ii) among individual souls, (iii) between individual soul s and
[GITA:15141] inert objects, (iv) between the Lord and  individual souls, and (v) between
[GITA:15142] the Lord and  inert objects. Verses 13.6 and 13.7 enumerated the different
[GITA:15143] components of nature that impact an individual’s personality. These
[GITA:15144] indicated the differences among the ine rt components of nature. Verse
[GITA:15145] 13.22 indicates that individual soul s experience different types of births
[GITA:15146] based on their interaction with the qualities of nature, and verse 13.31
[GITA:15147] refers to different living beings and hence they describe the difference that
[GITA:15148] exists be tween individual souls. Verses 13.20 and 13.21  describe the
[GITA:15149] impact of inert nature on living beings, highlighti ng the difference between
[GITA:15150] individual souls and inert objects. Verse 13.19 indicates  the difference
[GITA:15151] between inert nature and the Lord Almi ghty and verse 13.34  clarifies the
[GITA:15152] difference between the individual soul and the Lord Almighty.
[GITA:15166] Chapter 13                                                                                                                                     323
[GITA:15168] Summary of Chapter 13
[GITA:15170] As indicated in the intro ductory chapter, Sri Rayaru in GV  has
[GITA:15171] provided an excellent categorization of the 18 chapters of Gita by dividing
[GITA:15172] them into 3 groups of 6 chapters each. The last six chapters  (13 – 18)
[GITA:15173] provide details on some of the important c oncepts covered in the previous
[GITA:15174] chapters. In chapter 2, verses 2 -12 onwards, the attributes of individual
[GITA:15175] souls were described. In chapters 10, 11, 12 etc., the Lord’s forms,
[GITA:15176] attributes and grea tness were discussed. In verse 7.4 , the attributes of
[GITA:15177] eightfold inert nature were discussed. Arjuna now wants to understand
[GITA:15178] more about the interrelationships among the three entities – the Lord,
[GITA:15179] individual souls, and inert nature. This chapter provides clarification on this
[GITA:15180] topic and forms the philosophical basis for  the principle of fivefold
[GITA:15181] differences. In verse 13.1 , Arjuna requests details on the following six
[GITA:15182] topics – prakruti (inert nature) and purusha (individual soul), kshetra (field
[GITA:15183] of activity) and kshetrajna (one who fully knows about kshetra), jnana
[GITA:15184] (procedure to obtain knowledge) and jneya (the one who is to be known).
[GITA:15185] In verses 13.2 to 13.7 , the Lord provides details on kshetra and kshetrajna
[GITA:15186] and verses 13.8 to 13.19  cover the topics of  jnana and jneya. Verses 13.20
[GITA:15187] to 13.24 are related to prakruti and purusha. The remaining verses describe
[GITA:15188] the interaction and interrelationship s between these entities. The
[GITA:15189] relationship among the three entities in the universe, namely the individual
[GITA:15190] souls, inert nature that the Lord described in this chapter can be viewed a s
[GITA:15191] an explanation for the concept of fivefold differences ( pancha bheda )
[GITA:15192] which is one of the foundational principles of the philosophy of Sri
[GITA:15193] Madhwacharya.

[GITA:15210] Chapter 14 - Division of Qualities
[GITA:15212] Chapter Introduction: This chapter of 27 verses is termed
[GITA:15213] Gunatraya Vibhaga Yoga  (Division of Qualities). This chapter has details
[GITA:15214] on the three qualities of nature ( sattv – pious, rajas – passion, tamas –
[GITA:15215] ignorance) which define one s personality. These concepts were introduced
[GITA:15216] in chapter 3 (3.5) and are expanded here. The c reation of the universe
[GITA:15217] through sentient Mother Nature is described. The ways in which the three
[GITA:15218] qualities bind a person are also explained. The method to escape from the
[GITA:15219] clutches of the three qualities are described . The previous chapter had a
[GITA:15220] discussion on the interaction s between inert nature, the individual soul, and
[GITA:15221] the Lord. Verse 13.22 indicates  the impact of the three qualities of nature
[GITA:15222] on living beings. Activities of  living beings are influenced by the three
[GITA:15223] qualities of nature and such activities entangle them. This chapter provides
[GITA:15224] details on the three qualities of nature in terms of their origin, influence,
[GITA:15225] impact and more importantly, the method to overcome them.

[GITA:15238] One who realizes this knowledge will attain My abode and will not
[GITA:15239] be reborn during the next cycle of creation. Also, they will not suffer
[GITA:15240] during the next cycle of dissolution. (14.2)

[GITA:15255] Comments: For one to get freed from bondage and achieve
[GITA:15256] liberation, it is important to understand the ways that one gets influenced
[GITA:15257] by the three qualities of nature. The Lord had resolved to impart suc h
[GITA:15258] knowledge to Arjuna in verse 2.39 and expand ed on th e concepts
[GITA:15259] introduced in verse 3.5. In verse 14.1 , the Lord states that seekers who
[GITA:15260] understood this concept previously had attained liberation , and hence it is a
[GITA:15261] proven path. In vers e 14.2, the Lord states the rewards for those who attain
[GITA:15262] this knowledge during their spiritual journey. Such seekers will attain
[GITA:15263] moksha, which is identified as the state where one does not suffer from
[GITA:15264] worldly miseries that impact living beings who are subject to repeated
[GITA:15265] births and deaths. In that sense, t he state of moksha is identified as
[GITA:15266] ‘sadharmya’ (in an extremely limited  sense, somewhat like the state of the
[GITA:15267] Lord who is never subject to any miseries).

[GITA:15284] Comments: In these two verses, the Lord describes the process of

[GITA:15310] O Arjuna, Mighty Armed One! The three attributes, namely virtue
[GITA:15311] (sattva), passion ( rajas) and ignorance ( tamas) are born out of insentient
[GITA:15312] nature. These attributes tightly bind individua l souls which intrinsically do
[GITA:15313] not perish ( the governing deities for these three attributes are Sridevi,
[GITA:15314] Bhoodevi and Durgadevi which are forms of Goddess Mahalakshmi).
[GITA:15315] (14.5)
[GITA:15317] Comments: After describing the interaction between the Lord
[GITA:15318] Almighty and His co nsort, Goddess Mahalakshmi in the previous verse,
[GITA:15319] this verse outlines the process by which the three qualities of nature bind an
[GITA:15320] individual soul. Goddess Mahalakshmi, in her three forms of Sri, Bhoo, and
[GITA:15321] Durga governs the three qualities, namely virtue (sattva), passion ( rajas)
[GITA:15322] and ignorance ( tamas), respectively. In general, all living creatures are
[GITA:15323] entangled by these three qualities. Specifically, Goddess Sridevi binds
[GITA:15324] deities (angels), Goddess Bhoodevi binds humans, and Goddess Durgade vi
[GITA:15325] binds demons. Sr i Rayaru in GV  clarifies that souls who are in moksha
[GITA:15326] after liberation are not entangled by these qualities. The binding applies
[GITA:15327] only to beings who are not yet liberated. This is implied using the word
[GITA:15328] dehina (those with physical bodies). Liberated souls d o not have physical
[GITA:15329] bodies.

[GITA:15354] O Anagha (Arjuna, One without sins)! The quality of sattva is pure
[GITA:15355] and hence is ideal for acquiring spiritual knowledge. It removes defects and
[GITA:15356] diseases. It helps connect one with pure knowledge and bliss . (14.6)
[GITA:15358] O Son of Kunti! The quality of  rajas creates obsession and
[GITA:15359] attachment. It causes the feelings of desire and expectations with respect to
[GITA:15360] pursuing objects of sense pleasure. It binds one with passion ( sensory
[GITA:15361] pursuits). (14.7)
[GITA:15363] O Bharata! The quality of tamas is responsible for covering one with
[GITA:15364] ignorance. It can create delusion in everyone. It is responsible for
[GITA:15365] forgetfulness, lethargy, and excessive sleep. (14.8)
[GITA:15367] Comments: These three verses describe the impact of the
[GITA:15368] entanglement of the three qualities ( sattva, rajas, tamas ) on deities,
[GITA:15369] humans, and demons, respectively. It must be noted that even deities who
[GITA:15370] are destined for liberation will be bound by the quality of sattv till they
[GITA:15371] achieve divine, spiritual knowledge and attain liberation through the grace
[GITA:15372] of the Lord.

[GITA:15397] The quality of sattva leads one to joyful activities. Rajas leads one to

[GITA:15401] O Bharata! When the proportion of sattva in an individual exceeds
[GITA:15402] that of rajas and tamas, it then dominates over the other two. Similarly,
[GITA:15403] rajas and tamas will dominate when they are in higher proportion. (14.10)
[GITA:15405] Comments: After entangling living beings as described in previous
[GITA:15406] verses, the three qualities influence their character and hence their
[GITA:15407] activities. While the three qualities themselv es are inert entities, it is their
[GITA:15408] respective governing deities which are responsible for influencing  living
[GITA:15409] beings. How do these three qualities influence one wh o is entangled by all
[GITA:15410] three of  them? Verse 14.10  states the three qualities typically will not  be
[GITA:15411] present in equal proportions, and the one which is in higher proportion will
[GITA:15412] have the predominant influence.

[GITA:15556] is beyond these three qualities, and they act under His control and

[GITA:15579] Comments: After having described the influence and impact of the
[GITA:15580] three qualities of nature, the Lord says that one should strive to avoid
[GITA:15581] getting entangled by them. This will help one achieve liberation.
[GITA:15583] The quality of sattv (piety) is pure and influences one to pursue
[GITA:15584] spiritual studies which enables one to traverse on the right path. Why then
[GITA:15585] should one try to reach beyond even  the quality of  sattv? Sri Vidyamanya
[GITA:15586] Teertha in GPM  clarifies that some who attain spiritual knowledge can
[GITA:15587] develop arrogance and pride due to their achievements. One should avoid
[GITA:15588] getting trapped in arrogance and pride.

[GITA:15600] Comments: After listening to the Lord’s sermon on the origin,
[GITA:15601] influence, and impact of the three qualities of nature on living beings and
[GITA:15602] the need for one to reach beyo nd these qualities (verse 14.20), Arjuna is

[GITA:15627] On worldly issues, such people do not despise knowledge (due to sattva),
[GITA:15628] activity (due to rajas) or ignorance (due to tamas). But on the issue of the
[GITA:15629] Lord’s attributes, they crave for knowledge ( due to sattv) and activity (due
[GITA:15630] to rajas) and abhor delusion (due to tamas). (14.22)
[GITA:15632] Comments: The Lord responds to Arjuna’s questions about the traits
[GITA:15633] of those who overcome the influence of the three qualitie s in the following
[GITA:15634] four verses 14.22 to 14.25 . Many of t he abilities and attributes stated here
[GITA:15635] have been previously described in verses 2.55 to 2.59, 5.18 to 5.20, 6.7 to
[GITA:15636] 6.9, 12.13 to 12.30, 13.8 to 13.12 etc., while enumerating the characteristics
[GITA:15637] of seekers who are on the right spiritual path. The abilities  and attributes
[GITA:15638] described in these verses must be viewed in the context of one ’s
[GITA:15639] relationship with the three qual ities of nature. Sri Rayaru in GV  provides
[GITA:15640] the inner meanings of these verses  based on Sri Madhwacharya’s GB and
[GITA:15641] GTN.
[GITA:15643] The three qualities of n ature exist in two modes – gross and subtle.
[GITA:15644] The gross aspect of the three qualities of sattv, rajas and tamas leads one to
[GITA:15645] indulge in the respective pursuits of spiritual knowledge, sensory pleasure
[GITA:15646] and harmful lethargy. The subtle aspects of these three qualities result in
[GITA:15647] one displaying keen interest (due to sattv), some interest (due to rajas), and
[GITA:15648] disdain (due to tamas) respectively in learning about the Lord’s auspicious
[GITA:15649] attributes. One who has conquered the three qualities of nature does not
[GITA:15650] treat wi th contempt the outcomes of activities related to worldly matters.
[GITA:15651] However, with regard to learning about the Lord’s attributes, such a person
[GITA:15663] 334                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:15664] desires the impact of subtle aspects of sattv and rajas and abhors the impact
[GITA:15665] of tamas.
[GITA:15667] Sri Rayaru in GV  provides another meaning for this verse : One who
[GITA:15668] has conquered the three qualities of nature does not envy those who have
[GITA:15669] attained divine, spiritual knowledge due to sattv and does not wish for the
[GITA:15670] return of lost ignorant knowledge.

[GITA:15684] cannot act independently. They do not indulge in useless pursuits. (14.23)
[GITA:15686] They treat worldly happiness and distress with equanimity. They
[GITA:15687] look at a piece of gold and a lump of mud the same way. The pleasant and
[GITA:15688] the unpleasant, and praise and insult, are the same to them. (14.24)

[GITA:15710] performance of activities that please the Lord. They appear dispassionate
[GITA:15711] and indifferent in performing any activity, but they are quietly performing
[GITA:15712] activities that please Lo rd Vishnu. (The word udaseenavat mean ‘appear
[GITA:15713] indifferent’ due to the use of the qualifier vat). They will not stop
[GITA:15714] vaishnavic activities even if they ever come under the influence of the three
[GITA:15715] qualities, as they are aware that these qualities do not act i ndependently but
[GITA:15716] are under the control of the Lord.
[GITA:15718] Likewise, they do not stop propitiating the Lord if they do not see
[GITA:15719] any worldly gains. Similarly, they do not stop engaging in activities dear to
[GITA:15720] the Lord even if some in society consider those activitie s as unnecessary or
[GITA:15721] undesirable. They are also not impacted by the views of their friends or
[GITA:15722] foes in matters related to propitiating the Lord. In other words, they are
[GITA:15723] steadfast in their devotion to the Lord.

[GITA:15734] Comments: The previous verses describe the characteristics of one
[GITA:15735] who can reach beyond the three qualities of nature. How can a seeker attain
[GITA:15736] such superior characteristics? The Lord states that un alloyed devotion to
[GITA:15737] Him is the surest way for one to reach this state. Such a seeker will be freed
[GITA:15738] from the bondage imposed by sentient nature and will reach the abode of
[GITA:15739] Goddess Mahalakshm i who is the governing deity of  nature. As Goddess
[GITA:15740] Mahalakshmi entangles one with the three qualities of nature, one must first
[GITA:15741] please her to get liberated from bondage. As indicated previously (verse
[GITA:15742] 12.6), one must always propitiate Goddess Lakshmi together with her
[GITA:15743] consort, the Lord Almighty.

[GITA:15757] Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha in his BGS  has identified this verse as a
[GITA:15758] summary of this entire chapter. This verse makes a reference to the three
[GITA:15759] qualities of nature which bind a living being , and states that pure devotion
[GITA:15760] to the Lord is the way to overcome such entanglement. Hence, it is indeed
[GITA:15761] apt to consider this verse as a summary of this entire chapter.

[GITA:15770] Comments: The previous verse states that a devotee who has
[GITA:15771] crossed the three qualities of nature, will reach the abode of Goddess
[GITA:15772] Mahalakshmi, which is also the  abode of the Lord. A seeker who is on the
[GITA:15773] spiritual path will first reach the abode of Goddess Lakshmi and with Her

[GITA:15775] where the liberated souls will experience unending, uncorrupted bl iss.
[GITA:15777] Summary of Chapter 14
[GITA:15779] As indicated in the introductory section, the third set of chapters
[GITA:15780] (from Chapter 13 to 18), provide more details on specific concepts
[GITA:15781] discussed in the earlier sets of chapters. The previous chapter had a
[GITA:15782] discussion on the interaction between   inert nature, the individual soul, and
[GITA:15783] the Lord, and indicated the impact of the three qualities of nature, namely
[GITA:15784] sattv (piety), rajas (passion), and tamas (ignorance) on living beings.
[GITA:15785] Activities of living  beings are influenced by the t hree qualities of nature
[GITA:15786] and such activities entangle them. For one to get freed from bondage and
[GITA:15787] achieve liberation, it is important to understa nd the way  that one gets
[GITA:15788] influenced by the three qualities of nature. This chapter provides details on
[GITA:15789] the thre e qualities of nature in terms of their origin (verses 14.3 -14.4),
[GITA:15801] Chapter 14                                                                                                                                        337
[GITA:15803] entanglement (verses 14.5 –14.8), impact and result (verses 14.11 -14.18).
[GITA:15804] Verse 14.19 clarifies that the Lord Almighty controls the three qualities of
[GITA:15805] nature and is beyond their reach. The Lord also states in 14.21 that a seeker
[GITA:15806] should strive to traverse beyond these three qualities to achieve liberation.
[GITA:15807] In verses 14.22 to 14.27, the Lord enumerates the traits of those who escape
[GITA:15808] entanglement by these three qualities and eventually reach His abode.

[GITA:15825] Chapter 15 – Theology of The Supreme Being
[GITA:15827] Chapter Introduction:  This chapter of 20 verses is known as
[GITA:15828] Purushottama Yoga  (Theology of The Supreme Being) . This chapter is
[GITA:15829] principally concerned with the establishment of the principle of the Lord
[GITA:15830] Almighty’s supremacy and hence is termed Purushottama Yoga  where
[GITA:15831] uttama means Supreme and purusha means Being. This chapter is
[GITA:15832] considered by many to have the core teachings of the en tire Gita. The Gita
[GITA:15833] has 700 verses spread over 18 chapters.  Chapter 15 which has 20 verses ,
[GITA:15834] interestingly has 700 letters (15 verses  have 32 letters  each and the
[GITA:15835] remaining 5 verses  have 44 letters  each)! This gives credence to the
[GITA:15836] argument of this chapter ’s importance based on numerology. While the
[GITA:15837] Lord had previously described the components of the universe such as
[GITA:15838] living beings, inert objects, and the Lord, in this chapter , He illustrates the
[GITA:15839] interrelations among them using the example of a banyan tree. The Lord
[GITA:15840] had indicated His presence in  living beings previously, especially within
[GITA:15841] their hearts in  verses 9.4, 10.20, and 13.18 . This chapter provides more
[GITA:15842] details on the aspects of His presence in living beings. Further, in the
[GITA:15843] previous chapter 13.24 , it was stated that a seeker who understands the
[GITA:15844] relationship between the Lord ( purusha) and nature will eventually achieve
[GITA:15845] liberation. This chapter provides more details on the attributes of the Lord
[GITA:15846] (purusha). In verse 15, the Lord explicitly states His pre sence in everyone
[GITA:15847] and declares that He is the primary subject matter of the Vedas. In verses
[GITA:15848] 16 to 20, the Lord emphatically describes Himself as the Supreme Being ,
[GITA:15849] different from all other beings, thereby convincingly establishing the
[GITA:15850] philosophy of duali sm ( dvaita) which was popularized by Sri
[GITA:15851] Madhwacharya and other seers in his lineage such as Sri Jaya Teertha and
[GITA:15852] Sri Raghavendra Teertha.

[GITA:15877] The Lord said:  The eternal banyan tree of the Universe is
[GITA:15878] characterized by the following  - The Lord is like the earth that supports the
[GITA:15879] tree, Mother nature is the root of the tree. The 8 principles of nature are the
[GITA:15880] branches of the tree. The tree is eternally transforming like a running
[GITA:15881] stream. The Vedas are the leaves of this tree.  One who knows these, knows
[GITA:15882] the Vedas.
[GITA:15884] Comments: This enigmatic verse describes the universe using the
[GITA:15885] example of a banyan tree. One must carefully analyze eac h word to
[GITA:15886] understand the inner meanings in  this verse. Sri Rayaru in his GV based on
[GITA:15887] Sri Madhwacharya’s GB and GTN  provides an excellent interpretation for
[GITA:15888] this verse using the word derivation approach of Sanskrit.
[GITA:15890] Firstly, the word ‘oordhwa’ is derived from ‘uttamatvaat’ and means
[GITA:15891] ‘one that is superior ’. Further, in the Vedas, Lord Vishnu is described as
[GITA:15892] ‘oordhwa’, hence it refers to Lord Almighty Vishnu. Thus, Lord Vishnu is
[GITA:15893] the foundational component for the tree and hence represents the earth that
[GITA:15894] supports the tree. Sentient nature and its three qualities are governed by the
[GITA:15895] Lord’s consort Mahalakshmi who is superior to all other entities in the
[GITA:15896] universe and hence represents the three roots of this Tree of the Universe.
[GITA:15897] The word ‘adha’ means inferior an d represents the 8 principles of nature
[GITA:15898] (the 5 elements of physical nature and the principles of mahat -
[GITA:15899] consciousness, ahankara - individuation, and buddhi - intellect). These 8
[GITA:15900] principles and their governing deities are like the branches of this Tree of
[GITA:15901] the Universe. The tree is termed ashwattha (continuously transforming) and
[GITA:15902] avyaya (eternal). The word ‘ ashwattha’ can be derived in two ways.
[GITA:15903] (i) a + shwa + ttha , where shwa means ‘tomorrow’ a + shwa means ‘not
[GITA:15915] 340                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:15916] tomorrow’. Hence this word means that the state of the tree tomorrow is not
[GITA:15917] the same as it is today, which implies that the Universe is continuously
[GITA:15918] transforming. This is compared to a stream of running water, where water
[GITA:15919] is eternally running as a stream, but the content of water at any place at any
[GITA:15920] time is not the same as it is in  a previous instant. (ii) ashwattha is derived
[GITA:15921] from the word ‘ ashwa’ which means ‘horse’. A horse is constantly in
[GITA:15922] motion and does not stay still. Similarly, the universe is continuously in
[GITA:15923] motion. It should also be noted t hat previously in chapter 10 (10.26), the
[GITA:15924] Lord had stated that among all trees, He has a special presence in
[GITA:15925] ‘ashwattha’ (the banyan tree). The Vedas are like leaves of this tree. Just as
[GITA:15926] the leaves bloom and give rise to flowers and fruits, seekers who le arn the
[GITA:15927] Vedas will earn the fruits such as worldly riches and ultimately, moksha
[GITA:15928] (the Lord’s abode).

[GITA:15935] The branches of this Tree of the Universe are nourished by the three
[GITA:15936] qualities of nature and extend both above and below. The sprouts represent
[GITA:15937] the objects of sensory perception. The roots represent the Lord, sentient
[GITA:15938] nature, and inert nature. Nature along with its three qualities of sattv, rajas,
[GITA:15939] and tamas entangles living beings. Just like the roots of a tree are
[GITA:15940] responsible for the fruits grown, the rewards based on actions in this world
[GITA:15941] are due to  the Lord, sentient nature and the three qualities represented by
[GITA:15942] the roots. (15.2)
[GITA:15944] Comments: This verse co ntinues the description of the Tree of the
[GITA:15945] Universe and is even more enigmatic than the previous verse. In  the
[GITA:15946] previous chapter (14.5), it was stated that Goddess Mahalakshmi in her
[GITA:15947] three forms of Sri, Bhoo, and Durga controls the ‘gunas’, the three qualities
[GITA:15948] of nature (sattv, rajas, tamas). This verse states that the five basic elements
[GITA:15949] of nature and the three principles represented by the branches of this tree
[GITA:15961] Chapter 15                                                                                                                                       341
[GITA:15963] are influenced by the three qualities of nature  (gunas). Hence, the roots
[GITA:15964] which represent sentient and inert nature are superior to the branches which
[GITA:15965] represent the elements of nature and the three principles  (mahat, ahankara,
[GITA:15966] buddhi). The three qualities of nature (sattv, rajas, tamas ) are like  new
[GITA:15967] roots. The three principles and the five basic elem ents of nature present in a
[GITA:15968] living being are responsible for the objects of sensory perception which are
[GITA:15969] pursued by living beings. This was described previously in verses
[GITA:15970] 14.11 – 14.13. These objects of sensory pursuits are represented by the
[GITA:15971] sprouts whic h emanate from the branches of the tree. The sprouts have
[GITA:15972] temporary existence just like the experience of sensory pleasures by living
[GITA:15973] beings.
[GITA:15975] Sri Rayaru in GV  states that the above interpretation of the
[GITA:15976] components of the Tree of the Universe is based on t he description in the
[GITA:15977] Bhallava branch of the Vedas which states that the Lord who supports the
[GITA:15978] Tree of the U niverse is not part of the tree but is distinct from it.  The
[GITA:15979] components of the banyan tree (and their governing deities) in these two
[GITA:15980] verses can now be summarized as follows:
[GITA:15982] Earth (supporting the tree) = The Lord Almighty
[GITA:15983] Roots = Sentient and inert nature
[GITA:15984] New roots = The three qualities of nature
[GITA:15985] Branches = The five basic elements of nature , and the three
[GITA:15986] principles
[GITA:15987] Sub-branches = Physical bodies of living beings
[GITA:15988] Leaves = The Vedas
[GITA:15989] Flowers, Fruit = Worldly desires, Liberation
[GITA:15991] These two verses appear to illustrate the concepts of gradations
[GITA:15992] among various d eities described previously in 3.42  with the help of a
[GITA:15993] Banyan tree.

[GITA:16014] This tree is constantly evolving (like a flowing stream) and does not

[GITA:16016] should chop this tree with the sharp weapon of firm detachment (as the tree
[GITA:16017] has very strong roots ), to separate the hidden roots from other parts of the
[GITA:16018] tree (one should use the strong weapon of devotion and detachment to
[GITA:16019] understand the distinction between the Lord, Nature and the individual
[GITA:16020] souls). (15.3)
[GITA:16022] Comments: After having described the structure of the Tree of the
[GITA:16023] Universe in previous verses, this verse states the action that a seeker needs
[GITA:16024] to take to progress on the spiritual path. The tree is constantly evolving as
[GITA:16025] new sprouts, lea ves, flowers, and fruits bloom and the old ones wither.
[GITA:16026] However, the earth and the strong roots do not wither. Similarly, the
[GITA:16027] entities in the universe such as living beings and inert objects are constantly
[GITA:16028] changing but the Lord and Mother Nature who are  represented by  the
[GITA:16029] strong, foundational roots of this tree, are not subject to any change and do
[GITA:16030] not perish. This verse clarifies that the Lord who pervades all and is
[GITA:16031] invisible during the beginning and end of the universe (during the time
[GITA:16032] epoch kalpa) continues to be invisible during its lifetime. These conc epts
[GITA:16033] were previously stated in 9.7 and 9.10 . To completely understand the
[GITA:16034] Lord’s greatness, a seeker must chop this tree with a strong, sharp weapon
[GITA:16035] to be able to separate the tree from its foundation and understand its roots.
[GITA:16036] That sharp weapon is described as asanga = a + sanga . This word can be
[GITA:16037] interpreted in two ways – (i) asanga = detachment (as sanga means
[GITA:16038] attachment) which implies that one should detach oneself from worldly
[GITA:16039] matters, and (ii) asanga = involvement in activities pleasing to the Lord, as
[GITA:16040] the letter a represents the Lord. This concept is clarified by Sri
[GITA:16041] Prabhanjanacharya in GM.
[GITA:16053] Chapter 15                                                                                                                                       343

[GITA:16071] when one is aware of the distinction between the Lord and other entities in

[GITA:16123] an infinitesimal fr action of Me (similar in being eternal but distinct ly
[GITA:16124] separate in attributes and capabilities). The individual soul directs the six
[GITA:16125] sense organs (including the mind) towards objects of pleasure, propelled by
[GITA:16126] the qualities of nature. (15.7)
[GITA:16128] Comments: It wa s stated  previously (verse 5.14) that living beings
[GITA:16129] cannot act on their own and their activities are propelled and stimulated by
[GITA:16130] the Lord. This verse states that an infinitesimal fraction of the Lord is
[GITA:16131] present inside the physical bodies of individual soul s. This concept was
[GITA:16132] described earlier in verses 9.4, 10.20, 13.18  etc. This fraction of the Lord is
[GITA:16144] Chapter 15                                                                                                                                       345
[GITA:16146] like the individual soul as both are eternal in nature, but this fraction of the
[GITA:16147] Lord is vastly different and superior to all individual souls. This concep t is
[GITA:16148] described later in verses 15.16 – 15.20. Sri Rayaru in GV based on Sri
[GITA:16149] Madhwacharya’s GB states that a fraction or amsha of the Lord is of two
[GITA:16150] types – (i) bhinna amsha  (fraction that is different ) and (ii) swaroopa
[GITA:16151] amsha (intrinsic fraction, as in the case of the Lord’s various incarnations).
[GITA:16152] The fraction of the Lord present in living beings is like the individual soul
[GITA:16153] in the sense that a firefly is like the Sun, as both are illuminating objects but
[GITA:16154] are vastly different in attributes and capabilities.

[GITA:16159] At the time a soul enter s a body and at the time it leaves, the Lord
[GITA:16160] carries the sense organs (in a subtle form) into and out of the body, just like
[GITA:16161] a gentle, blowing wind carries the fragrance of flowers. (15.8)
[GITA:16163] Comments: Does an individual soul by itself direct attention
[GITA:16164] towards objects of sense pleasure? This verse is a continuation of the
[GITA:16165] previous verse and states that it is the Lord Almighty resident in living
[GITA:16166] beings who causes pursuit of sense pleasures. The Lord is always present in
[GITA:16167] living beings. When a soul leaves the physical body, the Lord causes the
[GITA:16168] sense organs of perception to travel along with the soul. Sense organs here
[GITA:16169] refer to the ir subtle form and not t he gross organs that one can see in a
[GITA:16170] physical body. The process of the subtle sense organs carried along with a
[GITA:16171] departing soul out of a physical body is compared to a gently blowing wind
[GITA:16172] that carries the fragrance of a flower. No one can see the fragrance  being
[GITA:16173] carried by the wind, but one can smell the fragrance. The flower does not
[GITA:16174] lose its fragrance even though  the wind carried a part of it. In the Brahma
[GITA:16175] Sutra (3-1- 4), it is stated that when a soul leaves the body and the body is
[GITA:16176] consumed by the elements of nature (such as fire), the sense organs also get
[GITA:16177] consumed. How can this be reconciled with the statement that the Lord
[GITA:16178] carries the sense organs alon g with the soul? Sri Rayaru in GV  clarifies by
[GITA:16179] stating that the Lord carries the subtle sense organs (a fraction of  the
[GITA:16191] 346                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita

[GITA:16200] (15.9)
[GITA:16202] Comments: It was stated previously in 9.4, 10.20, 13.18  etc., that the
[GITA:16203] Lord resides within the hearts of living beings , stimulating all thei r
[GITA:16204] activities. In 11.33 , the Lord declares to Arjuna that He has already killed
[GITA:16205] Arjuna’s enemies and that Arjuna is only an instrument, thereby confirming
[GITA:16206] that it is the Lord who performs all activities. Further, it was stated in 9.24
[GITA:16207] that the Lord is the consumer of  the fruits of all activities. While earlier
[GITA:16208] verses in this chapter such as 15.1, 15.2  described the structure of the Tree
[GITA:16209] of the Universe, in this verse the Lord who is resident in every living being
[GITA:16210] declares that He is the consumer of the objects of sense pursuits. It is
[GITA:16211] clarified in  the next verse that the Lord consumes only the
[GITA:16212] righteous/healthy fruits of activities.
[GITA:16214] This verse is identified by Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha in his BGS  as
[GITA:16215] representing the core concepts of this chapter. This verse establishes the
[GITA:16216] relationship between the Lord Almighty, the individual souls, and inert
[GITA:16217] objects (sense organs of all living beings). It also establishes the supremacy
[GITA:16218] of the Lord ( Purushottama Yoga ), His doership of activities and
[GITA:16219] consumption of righteous fruits of such activi ties, thereby establishing the
[GITA:16220] independence of the Lord, and the dependency of individual souls  and inert
[GITA:16221] objects. While the sense organs of perception are identified here, they are
[GITA:16222] governed by deities whose order of gradatio n was identified previously in
[GITA:16223] 3.42. Given the breadth of principles covered in this verse, it is apt to
[GITA:16224] recognize this as the core verse for this chapter.

[GITA:16246] Comments: Living beings experience both happiness and sadness
[GITA:16247] from indulgence in objec ts of sense pursuits. Since the Lord is the ultimate
[GITA:16248] consumer of fruits of sense pursuits, does He also experience happiness and

[GITA:16285] Comments: The next four verses describe the Lord’s presence in
[GITA:16286] specific entities. The Sun provides light and energy to the entire world.
[GITA:16287] However, the Sun is only one among millions of stars and all of them are
[GITA:16288] powered by the Lord. Sri Rayaru in GV  quotes the Brahma Sutra (1.3.22)
[GITA:16289] and Katha Upanishad (2.5.15) which state that the light and energy in the
[GITA:16290] Sun and the Moon are due to the Lord.  It is interesting to note the example
[GITA:16291] of 3 objects, namely, the Sun, the Moon, and fire in this verse. The Sun as a
[GITA:16292] star is an intrinsic source of light and energy. The Moon does not emanate
[GITA:16293] light on its own but reflects the light of the Sun. Fire in materials such as
[GITA:16294] wood and charcoal are not visible, but when one lights them, they emanat e
[GITA:16295] energy. So, these three types cover objects whose light and energy are seen
[GITA:16296] and objects whose light and energy are unseen.

[GITA:16316] Comments: As stated in verse 15.9 , the Lord resides in, and powers
[GITA:16317] the activities of all living beings. This verse describes the process of
[GITA:16318] digesting food powered by the Lord Almighty. Living beings consume four
[GITA:16330] Chapter 15                                                                                                                                       349

[GITA:16335] categories. The Lord, in the name of Vaishwanara resides in living beings
[GITA:16336] in the form of jatara agni (abdominal fire). Sri Rayaru in GV  clarifies that
[GITA:16337] the deity Mukhya Prana in the forms of prana and apana, powered by the
[GITA:16338] Lord, helps in the process  of food consumption and digestion which

[GITA:16351] the Vedas. (15.15)
[GITA:16353] Comments: This is one of the most important verses in the Gita as it
[GITA:16354] summarizes many of the key teachings related to the attributes and
[GITA:16355] greatness of the Lord. In this verse, the Lord emphatically declares that He
[GITA:16356] is resident in all living beings (within their hearts) and causes them to attain
[GITA:16357] knowledge and lose knowledge. The Vedas are scriptural texts that are
[GITA:16358] vocally passed on from one generation to the next. They are not authored
[GITA:16359] by anyone, human or divine. Various passages in the Vedas superficially
[GITA:16360] appear to propitiate deities such as Agni (fire), Varuna (water) etc. The
[GITA:16361] Lord clarifies here that the Vedas primarily describe Him alone (and
[GITA:16362] describe other deities secondarily). The Lord does not state that He is the
[GITA:16363] author of the Vedas, but states that He is the author of Vedanta. Sri Rayaru
[GITA:16364] in GV clarifies that Vedanta means vedanaamanto nirnayo  (the definitive
[GITA:16365] summary of the Vedas), in other words, the Brahma Sutras . This is

[GITA:16378] consistent with the historical fact that the Brahma Sutras were composed
[GITA:16379] by Lord Vedavyasa, wh o is another form of the Lord. Sri Rayaru in GV
[GITA:16380] also quotes the Bhagavata (11.21.42), where Lord Krishna teaches

[GITA:16386] There are two types of dependent souls in the Universe, kshara and

[GITA:16388] kshara and Goddess Mahalakshmi, the ever liberated and the one without  a
[GITA:16389] perishable body is akshara. (15.16)
[GITA:16391] Comments: After having described the Lord’s omnipresence,
[GITA:16392] omniscience, infinite strength  etc., in previous verses, the next 5 verses
[GITA:16393] categorically describe the supremacy of the Lord. This verse identifies two
[GITA:16394] types of dependent individual souls. Living beings are described as kshara
[GITA:16395] as they have perishable physical bodies. Even liberated souls have had
[GITA:16396] perishable bodies previously. The one without  a perishable body ( akshara)
[GITA:16397] is termed kootastha which means space (which is eternal).  This was stated
[GITA:16398] previously in 2.17 . The only dependent, sentient entity in the universe
[GITA:16399] which is eternal and has no perishable body is the Lord’ s consort
[GITA:16400] Mahalakshmi. Sri Rayaru in GV  clarifies that the masculine form akshara
[GITA:16401] to describe Goddess Mahalakshmi is an acceptable usage based on
[GITA:16402] Lakshmi’s strength that exceeds that of male deities. This is as per Sri
[GITA:16403] Madhwacharya’s commentary on the Chandogya Upanishat (3.15).

[GITA:16411] (The Supreme Among Beings). (15.17)

[GITA:16425] Comments: After having described the two dependent,  sentient
[GITA:16426] entities in the universe, namely kshara and akshara, the Lord declares that
[GITA:16427] there is another entity which is distinct from and superior to both. Sri
[GITA:16428] Vadiraja Teertha in his BGL  states that the word ‘ tu’ which precedes the
[GITA:16429] word ‘anya’ (different) indicates that this other entity is quite different
[GITA:16430] from the other two. This entity pervades all three worlds and provides
[GITA:16431] support and nourishment. Even though the three worlds suffer destruction
[GITA:16432] (at the time of the G reat Dissolution), the supreme entity c ontinues its
[GITA:16433] existence as indicated with the words ‘avyaya’ and ‘īśvaraḥ’. Hence it is
[GITA:16434] logical to describe this supreme entity as Paramatma (the supreme among
[GITA:16435] all souls). Sri Rayaru in GV  quotes the Shweta Upanishat (6.13) to
[GITA:16436] support the concepts in this verse.

[GITA:16444] scriptures. (15.18)
[GITA:16446] Comments: Is the Supreme Soul described in previous verse
[GITA:16447] different from Krishna? The Lord answers by confirming that He indeed is
[GITA:16448] the Supreme Soul. This fact is supported by ‘ loka’, scriptures that a re
[GITA:16449] composed, and the ‘Vedas’ which are revealed.
[GITA:16451] The use of the word ‘ api’ in akṣarād api (meaning - even akshara)
[GITA:16452] when referring to the Lord’s supremacy over Goddess Mahalakshmi
[GITA:16453] (akshara) is interesting. While one can generally understand the Lord’s
[GITA:16454] superiority over all individual souls, this verse states that He is superior to
[GITA:16455] even Goddess Lakshmidevi (who is worshipped as the Mother of this
[GITA:16456] Universe). This is to further emphasize the principle of the Supreme Being.

[GITA:16483] a seeker would develop deep conviction in the concept of duality

[GITA:16518] Purushottama (the supreme personality) is described in these verse s and
[GITA:16519] forms the basis for the title of this wonderful chapter - ‘Purushottama
[GITA:16520] Yoga’. Sri Madhwacharya quotes these 5 verses extensively in his works
[GITA:16521] such as Vishnu Tattva Vinirnaya, Mayavada Khandana, Sadachara
[GITA:16522] Smriti in addition to his two commentaries on the Gita.
[GITA:16524] Summary of Chapter 15
[GITA:16526] This chapter of 20 verses and 700 letters is considered by many to be
[GITA:16527] the most important chapter in the entire Gita, and the one that summarizes
[GITA:16528] all its 700 verses. This chapter is principally concerned with the
[GITA:16529] establishment of the principle of the Lord Almighty’s superiority and hence
[GITA:16530] is termed Purushottama Yoga  where uttama means supreme and purusha
[GITA:16531] means the Being. The relationship between the inert universe, individual
[GITA:16532] souls and the Lord Almighty were previously discu ssed. In this chapter,
[GITA:16533] these fivefold differences are explained with the ex ample of a banyan tree.
[GITA:16534] Verses 15.1 and 15.2  describe the structure of the tree. This description is
[GITA:16535] enigmatic, and one can appreciate the explana tion provided by Sri Rayaru
[GITA:16536] in GV  to help understand the real meaning of these verses. The
[GITA:16537] correspondence between the components of the tree and the entities in the
[GITA:16538] universe are as follows: Earth (supporting the tree) = The Lord Almighty;
[GITA:16539] Roots = Sentient and inert nature; New roots = The t hree qualities of
[GITA:16540] nature; Branches = The five basic elements of nature; Sub -branches =
[GITA:16541] Physical bodies of living beings; Leaves = The Vedas; Flower s,
[GITA:16542] Fruit = Worldly desires, Liberation. Using the analogy of a banyan tree,
[GITA:16543] these two verses appear to illus trate the concepts of gradations among
[GITA:16544] various d eities described previously in 3.42 . Verses 15.3 – 15.5 describe
[GITA:16545] the manner in which a seeker needs to approach the concepts in the Tree of
[GITA:16546] the U niverse to understand the nature of the Lord. Verses 15.6 to 15 .14
[GITA:16547] describe some specific attributes of the Lord such as omnipresence  and
[GITA:16548] omniscience. Verse 15.15  is one of the most famous verses in the Gita in
[GITA:16549] which the Lord emphatically declares His presence in the hearts of all
[GITA:16550] living beings and states that He is k nowable through the Vedas. Verses
[GITA:16551] 15.16 to 15.20  establish the relationship between the Lord Almighty,
[GITA:16563] 354                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:16564] individual souls, and the inert universe with the clear conclusion that the
[GITA:16565] Lord Almighty is supreme among and different from all individual souls
[GITA:16566] and in ert objects. These verses are distinguished by their clarity and
[GITA:16567] simplicity, which is different from the enigmatic nature of the initial few
[GITA:16568] verses. The term Purushottama (the supreme personality) is described in
[GITA:16569] these verses and forms the basis for the ti tle of this wonderful
[GITA:16570] chapter - ‘Purushottama Yoga’.

[GITA:16596] Chapter 16 – The Divine and the Demoniac
[GITA:16598] Chapter Introduction:  This chapter of 24 verses is known as
[GITA:16599] Daivasura Sampat Vibhaga Yoga  (Division of the Divine and the
[GITA:16600] Demoniac). This chapter delves deep into types of human nature. In  the
[GITA:16601] previous chapters, there were  many references to pious, virtuous people
[GITA:16602] with divine nature  and to people with demoniac nature. This c hapter
[GITA:16603] provides more details on human traits. These traits  are intrinsic to an
[GITA:16604] individual. One cannot judge people based on the external appearance,
[GITA:16605] position in society etc . In the pr evious chapter, verse 15.5  described the
[GITA:16606] methods to achieve divine, spiri tual knowledge and liberation. Verse 15.11
[GITA:16607] described those who can achieve self -realization and those who cannot.
[GITA:16608] These are the characteristics of divine and demoniac natures, respectively.
[GITA:16609] Some of these characteri stics were described in verses 9.11 to 9.1 4 also.
[GITA:16610] This chapter provides more details on the divine and demoniac
[GITA:16611] characteristics which help a seeker to inculcate divine attributes and avoid
[GITA:16612] association with demoniac ones. Hence this chapter is a logical extension to
[GITA:16613] the previous chapter.

[GITA:16639] The Lord Said: Fearlessness, purity in mind, conviction in the path of
[GITA:16640] divine knowledge, charitable  nature, self -restraint, involvement in
[GITA:16641] sacrificial activities, pursuance of Vedic stud y, austerity, uprightness.
[GITA:16642] (16.1)
[GITA:16644] Non-violent, truthful, devoid of anger, benevolent, faithful (to the
[GITA:16645] Lord Almighty), avers e to fault finding, compassionate, devoid of avarice,
[GITA:16646] gentle, modest, determined (to do good deeds). (16.2)
[GITA:16648] Valour, patience, fortitude, purity (physical and mental),  absence of
[GITA:16649] malice and ego. O Bharata! These attributes are observed in those with
[GITA:16650] divine nature. (16.3)
[GITA:16652] Comments: The Lord identifies 26 divine characteristics in these 3
[GITA:16653] verses. Fearlessness refers to one who is not only fearless, but also does not
[GITA:16654] cause fear in others. This was indicated earlier in 12.15  as the characteristic
[GITA:16655] of one who is d ear to the Lord. Sri Rayaru in GV  states that one who is
[GITA:16656] desirous of liberation must inculcate these characteristics.

[GITA:16667] Comments: The Lord now identifies some of the ch aracteristics of
[GITA:16668] those with demoniac natures. More details on demoniac nature and conduct
[GITA:16669] are detailed in verses 16.7 to 16.18.
[GITA:16683] Chapter 16                                                                                                                                           357

[GITA:16692] while demoniac nature pushes one to downfall. Do not despair. You
[GITA:16693] possess  divine nature. (16.5)
[GITA:16695] Comments: After identifying the 26 characteristics of those with
[GITA:16696] divine nature, the Lord comforts Arju na stating that he does not need to
[GITA:16697] despair as he is of divine nature. Arjuna  is an incarnation of the deity Indra
[GITA:16698] and has innate angelic characteristics.
[GITA:16700] Sri R ayaru in GV  draws attention to the use of the word vimokṣā
[GITA:16701] while referring to liberation. vimokṣā is derived as vividha + mokṣā,
[GITA:16702] meaning different levels of bliss in liberation based on the innate abilities
[GITA:16703] (yogyata) and efforts (sadhana) of souls.
[GITA:16705] Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha in his BGS  has identified this  verse as
[GITA:16706] representing the core concepts in chapter 16. Given that this chapter is
[GITA:16707] about divine and demoniac character and the fact that this verse identifies
[GITA:16708] the ultimate destination of the divine and the demoniac, it is apt to consider
[GITA:16709] this as the core v erse. In addition, in this verse the Lord also reiterates the
[GITA:16710] divine nature of Arjuna.

[GITA:16731] Comments: There are multifaceted personalities in this world.
[GITA:16732] Previously in chapter 9 (verses 9.11 – 9.14), characteristics of different
[GITA:16733] types of people were described. So, how can there be only two
[GITA:16734] characteristics – divine and demoniac? Sri Rayaru states in GV  that the
[GITA:16735] discussion in this chapter concern s those with significantly higher
[GITA:16736] proportions of divine and demoniac characteristics.

[GITA:16743] Those with demoniac natures do not have knowledge about

[GITA:16745] They are impure in mind and body. They do not have good conduct and are
[GITA:16746] not truthful. (16.7)
[GITA:16747] Comments: Verse 16.4  identified few major characteristics of
[GITA:16748] demoniac nature. The following 12 verses (16.7 to 16.18) ha ve a detailed
[GITA:16749] description of demoniac nature and resultant conduct.
[GITA:16750] The Lord uses the word ‘na’ thrice in the second line to indicate the
[GITA:16751] absence of each of the three characteristics  (namely purity, right conduct,
[GITA:16752] and truthfulness) in demoniac nature instead of  grouping them together. Sri
[GITA:16753] Rayaru in GV  explains that the reason for individually indicating their
[GITA:16754] absence is to convey the extent of complete absence of each of these three
[GITA:16755] attributes.

[GITA:16760] They say that the world is unreal and  is not dependent on the Lord

[GITA:16763] they say is a result of lustful co-existence. (16.8)
[GITA:16775] Chapter 16                                                                                                                                           359
[GITA:16778] Comments: Sri Rayaru in GV  provides two interpretations for the first
[GITA:16779] line of this verse:
[GITA:16781] 1. The words satya, pratishta, and īśvara all refer to the Lord Almighty
[GITA:16782] who is responsible for the  creation and the dissolution, the
[GITA:16783] sustenance, and the regulation of the universe (respectively signified
[GITA:16784] by these three names). Those with demoniac natures do not believe
[GITA:16785] in the supreme entit y with the above attributes (signified by the
[GITA:16786] prefix ‘a’ for the above three terms).
[GITA:16787] 2. Those with demoniac natures believe that the universe is unreal, has
[GITA:16788] no creator, and has no controller.
[GITA:16790] It must be noted that their nonbelief in the orderly creation of  the
[GITA:16791] entities in  the universe is inconsistent with the cyclic order of creation
[GITA:16792] described by the Lord in verse 3.14.
[GITA:16794] Author’s Note: The idea that the world is real has been widely discussed
[GITA:16795] in Hindu philosophical circles [OPM]. One school of thought hold s the
[GITA:16796] position that the world is neither real not unreal. It's proponents use an oft
[GITA:16797] quoted example of a seashell and a piece of silver to make the point. Our
[GITA:16798] Acharyas have pointed out the sheer futility of the argument which is based
[GITA:16799] on totally convoluted  and irrational thinking. That the world is real is a
[GITA:16800] position seminal to the philosophy of Sri Madhwacharya, and The
[GITA:16801] Bhagavad Gita itself supports this in its every verse.

[GITA:16827] Ignorant people with such viewpoints corrupt their minds

[GITA:16831] Addicted to insatiable desire, covered with vanity and conceit, they
[GITA:16832] justify their actions based on misinterpretations of scriptures and indulge in
[GITA:16833] pursuit of temporary, worldly pleasures. (16.10)
[GITA:16835] Such people, immersed in dangerous activities, endlessly pursue
[GITA:16836] gratification of the senses which they consider to be the goal of life. They
[GITA:16837] are convinced that there is no life beyond this world. (16.11)
[GITA:16839] Imprisoned by multitudes of unfulfilled desires, overcome by lust
[GITA:16840] and anger, they indulge in illegal and unethical means to earn wealth,
[GITA:16841] primarily for physical pleasures. (16.12)
[GITA:16843] Comments: These fou r verses describe the actions of those with
[GITA:16844] demoniac natures and the excuses they provide to justify their actions. They
[GITA:16845] do not just act out of impulse, but rather use the basis of misinterpreted
[GITA:16846] scriptures t o justify their actions. Verse 16.12  identifies the passion s of
[GITA:16847] kama (lust) and krodha (anger) as the root cause for immoral activities.
[GITA:16848] This was also indicated previously in verse 3.37.

[GITA:16877] have achieved everything. I am strong. I am born in a rich and famous

[GITA:16880] ignorance. (16.13) (16.14) (16.15)
[GITA:16882] Comments: These three verses describe the attitudes of those with
[GITA:16883] demoniac natures. These have been identified pre viously by the Lord as the
[GITA:16884] attributes that a seeker should avoid. The Lord had proclaimed in many
[GITA:16885] verses ( (5.14), (5.15), (15.9) ) that no one can act on their own and all
[GITA:16886] actions are due to Him. Yet, those with demoniac nature claim ownership
[GITA:16887] of their succ esses and achievements . In verse 2.18 , the Lord clarified that
[GITA:16888] no one could kill someone else (as the soul is indestructible and even the
[GITA:16889] destruction of the physical body is only due to the Lord alone). Yet those
[GITA:16890] with demoniac natures claim that they alo ne destroy their opponents. In
[GITA:16891] 6.41, it was stated that one ’s future births are based on one’s past sincere
[GITA:16892] efforts. Yet, those with demoniac natures boast about their family  and
[GITA:16893] lineage. They also make inconsistent claims. While they claim that they are
[GITA:16894] indeed the Lord Himself, they also claim that they perform ritual sacrifices.
[GITA:16895] If they are the Lord themselves, who do they propitiate in their ritual
[GITA:16896] sacrifices? Their ritual and outwardly religious activities are a sham show
[GITA:16897] to project a favourable image of themselves to society.

[GITA:16924] distressful pursuits. Imprisoned by ignorance, they get addicted to self-
[GITA:16925] destructive sense gratification and fall into abominable hell. (16.16)
[GITA:16927] Such people are complacent about themselves, are deluded by vanity,
[GITA:16928] and are arrogant due to their wealth and success. They perform religious
[GITA:16929] rituals without proper procedures in order to show off. (16.17)
[GITA:16931] They exhibit ego, arrogance, selfishness, lust, and short temper. They

[GITA:16936] nature. In verse 16.17 , it is stated that they are compl acent about
[GITA:16937] themselves. This trait is seen in some , who, under the garb of charity
[GITA:16938] donate money for some cause and expect publicity for societal acceptance
[GITA:16939] and recognition. They claim that they perform activities independently and

[GITA:16986] One should get rid of these three harmful characteristics. (16.21)
[GITA:16988] Comments: In this verse the Lord identifies the main human
[GITA:16989] passions that propel one towards harmful activities leading to
[GITA:16990] self-destruction. These are lust, anger, and greed. Lust is the never -ending
[GITA:16991] desire for physical grat ification. Previously in verse 3.37 , the Lord stated
[GITA:16992] the negative impacts of kama (lust) and krodha (anger). In verse 1.38 ,
[GITA:17004] 364                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:17005] Arjuna himself had stated that the Kauravas were bl inded by their greed
[GITA:17006] (lobha) for a share of a kingdom which did not belong to them. This greed
[GITA:17007] eventually destroyed th e Kauravas . Anger occurs when one is not able to
[GITA:17008] fulfil ones desires. Greed is the emotion that causes one to accumulate
[GITA:17009] excess wealth at any cost for fulfilling unending desires. These three
[GITA:17010] emotions are identified as the doors to hell as they stimulate destructive
[GITA:17011] behaviour leading to unrecoverable downfall.

[GITA:17037] cause one to indulge in harmful activities, the next three verses describe the
[GITA:17038] method for one to get freed from the clutches of these emotions. The Lord
[GITA:17050] Chapter 16                                                                                                                                           365
[GITA:17052] states that one should resort to scriptures which act as guidelights for
[GITA:17053] seekers on the journey of life. Scriptures such as the Upanishads, the
[GITA:17054] Bhagavata, the Ramayana and of course, the Mahabharata contain
[GITA:17055] many episodes to help a seeker discriminate between moral and immoral
[GITA:17056] actions, especially where there are grey areas.
[GITA:17058] Summary of Chapter 16
[GITA:17060] Some of the characteristics of the divine and the demoniac were
[GITA:17061] described in chapter 9, verses 9.11-14. This chapter provides more details
[GITA:17062] on these characteristics.  People with divine nature s typically exhibit the
[GITA:17063] following traits: honesty, straightforwardne ss, compassion, gentleness,
[GITA:17064] sense control, peace of mind, pleasing personality, helpfulness, anger
[GITA:17065] control, purity in body and mind, charit able nature . These are covered in
[GITA:17066] verses 16.1-3. Those with demoniac nature s are characterized by some of
[GITA:17067] these trait s: arrogance, anger, obstina cy, attachment to worldly pleasures,
[GITA:17068] disrespect towards  teachers and elders, conceit, cruel ty, hypocri sy etc.
[GITA:17069] These are described in verses 16.7 -18. The destination for those with
[GITA:17070] demoniac conduct (a result of their demoniac nature) is described in verses
[GITA:17071] 16.19-21. Verses 16.22-23 describe the methods for one to overcome
[GITA:17072] demoniac tendencies. This chapter concludes in verse 16.24 with Lord
[GITA:17073] Krishna declaring that one needs to resort to the scriptures to discriminate
[GITA:17074] between right and wrong actions.

[GITA:17091] Chapter 17 - The Threefold Faith
[GITA:17093] Chapter Introduction:  This chapter of 28 verses is termed
[GITA:17094] Shraddhatraya Vibhaga Yoga  (The Threefold Faith). In the previous
[GITA:17095] chapters, especially in chapter 14, the nature of individuals influenced by
[GITA:17096] the qualities of sattv, rajas, tamas  was stated in many places. This chapter
[GITA:17097] has more details on the concept of threefold faith. In chapter 14, verse
[GITA:17098] 14.19, it was stated that all activities are influenced by the combination of
[GITA:17099] the three qualities of inert nature and that the Lord Almighty is beyond
[GITA:17100] these attributes and hence is not influenced by them . Everyone has faith or
[GITA:17101] belief about the purpose of life. This belief is born out of t heir innate
[GITA:17102] nature. In this chapter, more details on the impact of the innate qualities of
[GITA:17103] living beings are described , especially on issues such as faith, food habits,
[GITA:17104] austerity, and charitable giving. While chapter 14 dealt with the impact of
[GITA:17105] the three q ualities of nature on living beings, this chapter deals with the
[GITA:17106] three types of faith that are intrinsic to all living beings.

[GITA:17114] Arjuna said: O Krishna! Some worship and perform sacrifices with
[GITA:17115] sincerity, but without knowing scriptural procedures. What is their
[GITA:17116] conviction? Is it sattvic (virtuous), rajasic (passion) or tamasic
[GITA:17117] (ignorance)? (17.1)
[GITA:17119] Comments: In the last verse of the pre vious chapter 16.24, the Lord
[GITA:17120] stated that the scriptures are the guidelights for a seeker to discriminate
[GITA:17121] between right and wrong deeds. Arjuna wants to know about those who do
[GITA:17133] Chapter 17                                                                                                                                          367
[GITA:17135] not know about scriptural procedures. If they perform deeds with sincerity,
[GITA:17136] would they be sattvic, rajasic or tamasic?
[GITA:17138] Outwardly, the phrase śāstravidhim uts ṛjya seems to refer to those
[GITA:17139] who ignore the procedures indicated in  the scriptures. Sri Rayaru in GV
[GITA:17140] based on Sri Madhwacharya’s GB states that this phrase refers to those who
[GITA:17141] do not have knowledge about scriptural procedures. After all, not everyone
[GITA:17142] has access to the scriptures, yet they also perform meditation, charity etc.,
[GITA:17143] based on their belief system. The question that Arjuna is asking is about the
[GITA:17144] nature of their activities. This will be clear after Lord’s response in the next
[GITA:17145] two verses.

[GITA:17151] The Lord said:  Living beings are predisposed (based on their innate

[GITA:17153] their description. (17.2)
[GITA:17155] Comments: Every soul has  an intrinsic nature that defines its
[GITA:17156] predisposition. The Lord describes such predisposition.

[GITA:17161] O Bharata! Everyone’s faith is conditioned according to the innate

[GITA:17165] Comments: Intrinsic predisposition in living beings defines their
[GITA:17166] faith. It is this  faith that is the basis of one ’s attitudes, personality, and
[GITA:17167] activities. When one is liberated, one’s state will be based on one’s intrinsic
[GITA:17179] 368                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:17180] predisposition (sattvic, rajasic, or tamasic). Sri Rayaru in GV  clarifies that
[GITA:17181] despite one’s intrinsic predisposition, one may exhibit other characteristics
[GITA:17182] to a small extent based on the impact of one’s environment. Intrinsic
[GITA:17183] predisposition in souls is like the feature of magnetism in magnets which
[GITA:17184] naturally attracts iron but no other metals. Magnetism in that sense is an
[GITA:17185] intrinsic quality that cannot be separated from a magnet.  Sri Madinur
[GITA:17186] Vishnu Teertha in his BGS has identified this verse as representing the core
[GITA:17187] concepts in this chapter  as it identifies the root cause that determines one’s
[GITA:17188] faith.

[GITA:17212] tamasic beings are identified in these verses. When the sattvic propitiate

[GITA:17226] deities such as Brahma, Indra etc., due to their faith in Lord Almighty
[GITA:17227] Vishnu, the y envision the indwelling Lord Vishnu in these deities , and
[GITA:17228] hence will attain His abode ( moksha). Others such as rajasas who
[GITA:17229] propitiate these deities without considering the indwelling Lord  are
[GITA:17230] propitiating other capricious spirits with the same name as B rahma, Indra
[GITA:17231] etc. They will only experience temporary rewards in  a heaven like abode.
[GITA:17232] This is clarified by Sri Rayaru in GV.

[GITA:17239] Food preferred by living beings are also of three types. Likewise, are
[GITA:17240] sacrificial rituals, austerity , and charitable activities. Listen  to their

[GITA:17243] Comments: The innate nature of living beings impact s their lives in
[GITA:17244] terms of food habi ts, perform ance of daily rituals , and even their attitude
[GITA:17245] and approach towards charitable giving. These are explained in detail in
[GITA:17246] verses 17.8 to 17.22.
[GITA:17248] As per  the Chandogya Upanishat  (6.5.1), food items have three
[GITA:17249] components – gross, middle part and subt le part. The gross part is normally
[GITA:17250] excreted, the middle part gives nourishment to the body and the subtle part
[GITA:17251] impacts the mind. Hence, the type of foo d consumed not only impacts one s
[GITA:17252] physical health, but also has an impact on one’s mental health.

[GITA:17271] Sattvic (virtuous) people like food items that are pleasant,
[GITA:17272] nourishing, sweet, tasty, and are easy to digest. They enhance longevity,
[GITA:17273] vitality, and health, and induce happiness and good nature. (17.8)
[GITA:17275] Comments: ‘You are what you eat’ is a famous saying which
[GITA:17276] indicates that ones nature is defined by one ’s food habits. Those wi th
[GITA:17277] sattvic nature prefer food items that promote health and longevity. These
[GITA:17278] food items are endowed with four basic characteristics which make them
[GITA:17279] tasty (rasyāḥ), juicy (snigdhāḥ), nourishing (sthirā), and hearty (hṛdyā). An
[GITA:17280] example of nourishing (sthirā) food is ghee which stays in the blood stream
[GITA:17281] for a long-time giving strength to the individual. Hearty ( hṛdyā) food items
[GITA:17282] are those (ex: sweet dishes) whi ch not only give joy while they are
[GITA:17283] consumed but also create craving. Moderate amount s of such healthy, tasty
[GITA:17284] food promote health  and wellbeing, and induce good nature. Sri
[GITA:17285] Vidyasagara Madhava  Teertha gives the example of a lamp that requires
[GITA:17286] both the wick  (batti) and ghee/oil to give light. Similarly, a body needs
[GITA:17287] ghee for nourishment which helps to light one’s intellect.

[GITA:17292] Rajasic (passionate) people like food items that are extremely

[GITA:17296] Comments: This verse describes the food habits of the rajasic.
[GITA:17297] While food items which are sou r, salty e tc., are also essential for one ’s
[GITA:17298] wellbeing, they need to be consumed in moderation. When consumed in
[GITA:17299] excess (atī), they result in misery at the time of consumption. Long term ill
[GITA:17300] effects include onset of diseases. For example, while salt is an essential
[GITA:17301] source of sodium for the body, excess intake of salt over a prolonged period
[GITA:17302] is known to result in high blood pr essure. Sri Rayaru in GV  clarifies that
[GITA:17303] these food items when consumed in moderation and without resulting in
[GITA:17304] discomfort or disease, can be considered sattvic.

[GITA:17362] Comments: Sattvic ones perform ritual sacrifices as worship to the
[GITA:17363] Lord. Feeding the needy and charitable giving are integral parts of any
[GITA:17364] ritual sacrifice performed to propitiate deities. Those with rajasic nature,
[GITA:17365] perform ritual sacrifices as a show to demonstrate their power in society.
[GITA:17366] Those with tamasic natures perform such rituals with ulterior motives and
[GITA:17367] never donate to those less fortunate.

[GITA:17384] Using words and speech that do not cause anxiety in others, that are
[GITA:17385] pleasant to hear, that are truthful and  aid in spiritual stud y constitutes

[GITA:17392] Comments: Austerity is self -discipline that is visible in one ’s
[GITA:17393] actions. It has three components : physical, vocal, and mental. One ’s nature
[GITA:17394] is also influenced by one ’s attitude and approach to austerity. Those with

[GITA:17426] Austerity sincerely observed by people is also of three types. Sattvic
[GITA:17427] austerity is one that is performed as an offering to the Lord, without any

[GITA:17430] Austerity performed to display one’s wealth and position, and to gain
[GITA:17431] adulation and praise from society, resulting in uneven, vanishing rewards is
[GITA:17432] rajasic. (17.18)
[GITA:17434] Austerity performed out of superstitions, with great pain to the self
[GITA:17435] and with the intention of harming others is tamasic. (17.19)
[GITA:17437] Comments: After having identified the characteristics of austerity
[GITA:17438] exercised physically, vocally, and mentally, the next three verses describe
[GITA:17439] the differences in the attitude and approach of those with sattvic, ra jasic,
[GITA:17440] and tamasic natures. Sattvic ones exercise austerity as service to the Lord,
[GITA:17452] 374                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:17453] the rajasic approach austerity with an ulterior motive of societal

[GITA:17476] Comments: Charitable donations performed by individuals are also
[GITA:17477] of three types. The sattvic donate whole heartedly without an y expectation
[GITA:17478] of recognition and consider it their duty. Their only goal is to please the
[GITA:17479] Lord. The rajasic donate out of fear (of reprisals afterlife), out of

[GITA:17481] tamasic donate with ulterior motives to the undeserving with disrespect.

[GITA:17505] In the scriptures, the Lord is addressed with three principal names -
[GITA:17506] Om (omnipresent), Tat (one who is known indirec tly, through the Vedas)
[GITA:17507] and Sat (full of infinite auspicious attributes). The Lord made available the
[GITA:17508] Vedas and Vedic sacrifices and powered the intellect of priests to perform
[GITA:17509] them. (17.23)
[GITA:17511] Comments: Sattvic living beings perform all their activities,
[GITA:17512] especially ritual sacrifices, austerity, and charitable giving as a worship and
[GITA:17513] offering to the Lord. It is important for one to remember the Lord before
[GITA:17514] undertaking such activities. The next four verses state that the scriptures
[GITA:17515] address the Lord with three  succinct, yet powerful adjectives, Om, Tat and
[GITA:17516] Sat. These have special meanings. Om which is derived from ‘ otam
[GITA:17517] protaha’ refers to the one who indwells (and supports) the universe. Tat
[GITA:17518] means one who pervades  the Gunas ( qualities). It also means one who
[GITA:17519] cannot be comprehended by the sense organs and can only be known
[GITA:17520] through the scriptures. Sat refers to the Lord who is devoid of any defects
[GITA:17521] and is full of infinite, auspicious attributes.

[GITA:17544] Hence, the activities of ritual sacrifice, austerity, and charity
[GITA:17545] performed as per the scriptures are always initiated by invoking the
[GITA:17546] primordial syllable ‘Om’, as a prayer to the Lord Almighty. (17.24)
[GITA:17548] Those desirous of achieving eternal bliss and not interested in
[GITA:17549] temporary heavenly pleasures perform sacrifices, penances, and charity as
[GITA:17550] an offering to the Lord described by the word ‘ Tat’, as one who is to be
[GITA:17551] understood indirectly (through the scriptures). (17.25)
[GITA:17553] O Partha! The Lord’s name, ‘Sat’, is used to represent existence and
[GITA:17554] goodness. It is also used to denote auspicious activities. (17.26)
[GITA:17556] Comments: These three verses describe the impact of invoking the
[GITA:17557] Lord’s names Om, Tat, Sat at the time of performing activities such as
[GITA:17558] ritual sacrifices, austerity, and charitable giving. Invoking the Lord’s name
[GITA:17559] Om, ensures th at these activities will be rendered sattvic. Before chanting
[GITA:17560] any hymn, one must precede it with Om, which renders the hymn fruitful.
[GITA:17561] Likewise, one must complete chanting of hymns with Om in the end, else
[GITA:17562] any blessings that would accrue from the hymn would be lost.
[GITA:17564] When one invokes the Lord’s name Tat, one is reminded that the
[GITA:17565] Lord is knowable indirectly (through the scriptures) and that one should
[GITA:17566] perform activities without expectations of temporary rewards.
[GITA:17568] Invoking the Lord’s name Sat will remind a seeker to be aware of the
[GITA:17569] Lord’s infinite, auspicious attributes, and activities such as the creation of
[GITA:17570] the universe.
[GITA:17572] In summary, invoking the phrase Om, Tat, Sat  at the time of
[GITA:17573] performing virtuous activities will help a seeker develop a virtuous attitude
[GITA:17574] and approach to them.

[GITA:17599] O Partha! Sacrifices performed, charity given, and austerities
[GITA:17600] observed, if done without faith and devotion to the Lord will be
[GITA:17601] counterproductive and constitute ‘ Asat’. Such activities help neither here
[GITA:17602] nor hereafter. (17.28)
[GITA:17604] Comments: The Lord concludes the discussion o f ‘The Threefold
[GITA:17605] Faith’ with these two verses by summarizing the characteristics of activities
[GITA:17606] performed with sincerity and those performed without sincerity. Activities
[GITA:17607] performed with sincerity, without expectations of rewards and as an
[GITA:17608] offering to the Lord will indeed help a seeker reach the Lord’s abode.
[GITA:17609] Activities that are performed with ulterior mo tives for societal recognition,
[GITA:17610] without following scriptural procedures and without offering to the Lord
[GITA:17611] are inauspicious and will neither help in this world nor in afterlife. Hence
[GITA:17612] faith and sincerity are very essential when performing activities.
[GITA:17614] Summary of Chapter 17
[GITA:17616] In this chapter the Lord identifies the three divisions of faith - sattvic,
[GITA:17617] rajasic and tamasic which influence the attitudes and activities of living
[GITA:17618] beings. These attributes are innate ( swabhava) to individual souls. The
[GITA:17619] impact of these attributes on activities such as worship, food habits, ritual
[GITA:17620] sacrifices, austerity, and charitable services are described. Verses 17.4 to
[GITA:17621] 17.7 describe the mode of propiti ation of living beings. Verses 17.8 to
[GITA:17633] 378                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:17634] 17.10 describe food habits. V erses 17.11 to 1 7.13 identify ritual sacrifices
[GITA:17635] based on one’s innate attributes. Verses 17.14 to 17.19  describe one’s
[GITA:17636] approach to austerity and meditation. Verses 17.20 to 17.22  address the
[GITA:17637] issue of charitable giving. Verses 17.23 to 17.27 describe the approach
[GITA:17638] towards ritual sacrifices and penance performed by sattvic beings desirous
[GITA:17639] of moksha, with special explanation on Om, Tat, and Sat, the three principal
[GITA:17640] names of the Lord Almighty.

[GITA:17661] Chapter Introduction:  This c hapter of 78 verses  is termed
[GITA:17662] Mokshasanyasa Yoga  (Liberation and Renunciation) . It starts with a
[GITA:17663] discussion on the subtle differences between renunciation ( sanyasa) and
[GITA:17664] relinquishment of rewards  from labour ( tyaga). The types of rewards from
[GITA:17665] actions are also discussed. The five prerequisites of performing any action
[GITA:17666] are identified. Different types of knowledge, action, doers, intellect,
[GITA:17667] determination, and happiness are also discussed. Additional details are
[GITA:17668] provided on four societal categories of people which were briefly indicated
[GITA:17669] in 4.13 . The concept of liberation ( moksha) is discussed  in detail  in this
[GITA:17670] chapter. The first 55 verses contain discussion s on the topics identified so
[GITA:17671] far. The Lord co ncludes His sermon in the next 17 verses. Arjuna responds
[GITA:17672] to Lord Krishna’s entire teaching in verse 73. Sanjaya, who has been
[GITA:17673] describing the proceedings in the war to King Dhrutarashtra  concludes his
[GITA:17674] commentary in the remaining 5 verses. Arjuna starts by requesting Krishna
[GITA:17675] to explain the difference between renunciation ( sanyasa) and
[GITA:17676] relinquishment  (tyaga) as both seem to imply the same. The Lord provides
[GITA:17677] answers to Arjuna’s questions with a detailed description of the various
[GITA:17678] aspects of renunciation and r elinquishment. This chapter expands on the
[GITA:17679] concept of doership, provides more details on  the influence of the three
[GITA:17680] qualities of nature and gives additional explanation on societal categories.
[GITA:17681] There is further an elaborate discussion on the methods to achieve salvation
[GITA:17682] (moksha). The Lord also describes the glory of the Gita.

[GITA:17702] Arjuna said:  O Krishna, Mighty Armed One! O Hri shikesha! O
[GITA:17703] Slayer of Demon Keshi!  I would like to understand the difference between
[GITA:17704] renunciation and relinquishment. (18.1)
[GITA:17706] Comments: In verse 5.2, it was stated that renunciation ( sanyāsa) is
[GITA:17707] essential to attain liberation ( moksha), and in verse 12.12  relinquishment
[GITA:17708] (tyāga) was lauded as a superior means to attain liberation ( moksha).
[GITA:17709] Arjuna wants to know the  difference between these two approaches. The
[GITA:17710] Lord provides a detailed response to Arjuna in verses 18.2 to 18.12.

[GITA:17719] The Lord said:  Learned ones say that renunciation is the
[GITA:17720] abandonment of activities performed for the sake of desired outcomes. The
[GITA:17721] experienced say that relinquishment is forsaking of fruits of any action.
[GITA:17722] (18.2)
[GITA:17724] The wise declare that engaging in desire ridden activities should  be
[GITA:17725] relinquished as they entangle a soul. Others say that one should never
[GITA:17726] abandon activities such as ritual sacrifice, charity, and penance. (18.3)
[GITA:17728] Comments: The Lord identifies four principles in these verses – (i)
[GITA:17729] abandonment of activities performed for mundane desires (ii) forsaking any
[GITA:17730] rewards from action (except the lofty goal of earning the Lord’s grace) (iii)
[GITA:17731] abandonment of activities which entangle one , and (iv) non -abandonment
[GITA:17732] of prescribed activities of ritual sacrifices, charity, and aust erity. Sri
[GITA:17733] Madhwacharya in GB and GTN  clarifies that all these principles are
[GITA:17734] required for one to make progress in one’s spiritual journey. The use of
[GITA:17746] Chapter 18                                                                                                                                           381
[GITA:17748] terms ‘ kavayo’ (learned ones), ‘ vicakṣaṇāḥ’ (the experienced),
[GITA:17749] and‘manīṣiṇaḥ’ ( the wise) to describe the propon ents of these four
[GITA:17750] principles is proof that all four are desirable qualities in a seeker.

[GITA:17756] relinquishment. O Superior among Men! Relinquishment is of three types.
[GITA:17757] (18.4)
[GITA:17759] Comments: To clarify that there is no contradiction between
[GITA:17760] renunciation and relinquishment, the Lord states that re linquishment is of
[GITA:17761] three types. However, the se three types are not identifi ed in this verse. Sri
[GITA:17762] Rayaru in GV describes the three types of relinquishments as follows -
[GITA:17764]  As per verse 18.2, relinquishment is forsaking rewards of activities.
[GITA:17765]  As will be seen in verse 18.6, relinquishment is forsaking ownership
[GITA:17766] in activities.
[GITA:17767]  As will be seen in verse 18.17, relinquishment is not assuming
[GITA:17768] independent doership in activities.
[GITA:17770] Another interpretation for the types of relinquishments is classification
[GITA:17771] based on sattvic (pious), rajasic (passionate) and tamasic (ignorant) modes
[GITA:17772] explained later in verses 18.7 to 18.9.

[GITA:17792] One should never abandon performing prescribe d ritual sacrifices,
[GITA:17793] austerity, and charity. These help purify a person. (18.5)
[GITA:17795] O Partha! One should detach oneself from ego in actions and
[GITA:17796] perform them without expectations.  This is My definite opinion. (18.6)
[GITA:17798] Comments: In these two verses, the Lord ma ndates that one should
[GITA:17799] never abandon one ’s prescribed duties and should perform them without
[GITA:17800] attachment to the actions themselves and without expectations. As the Lord
[GITA:17801] states that performing ritual sacrifices, austerity and charity are mandatory
[GITA:17802] for everyone, how does this apply to ascetics, and to those who do not have
[GITA:17803] access to Vedic knowledge? Ascetics are prohibited from performing fire
[GITA:17804] rituals and since they do not earn any income , they cannot perf orm any
[GITA:17805] charity. Sri Rayaru in GV  states that ritual sa crifices are of different ty pes
[GITA:17806] as stated earlier in verse 4.25  etc. The ritual sacrifice , for ascetics, is jnana
[GITA:17807] yagna (sacrifice of knowledge) which involves continuous study of
[GITA:17808] scriptures, teaching students, lectures to the lay people  etc. Charity , for
[GITA:17809] ascetics, is donating their time and knowledge to those in need. Austerity ,
[GITA:17810] for ascetics , is observing strict rituals such as celibacy, fasting etc. Those
[GITA:17811] who do not have access to Vedic knowledge perform ritual sacrifice in the
[GITA:17812] form of prayers and bhajans  on the Lord, and austerity for them is being
[GITA:17813] truthful, fasting etc.

[GITA:17839] Renouncing prescribed duties is never appropriate. Avoiding such
[GITA:17840] actions out of ignorance is tamasic. (18.7)
[GITA:17842] Abandonment of  prescribed duties under  the pretext of stress and
[GITA:17843] physical difficulty is rajasic. No one can earn the Lord’s grace through
[GITA:17844] such renunciation. (18.8)
[GITA:17846] O Arjuna! Performing prescribed duties without attachment to
[GITA:17847] actions and without expectations is sattvic renunciation. (18.9)
[GITA:17849] Comments: In these verses, the Lord identifies the types of
[GITA:17850] renunciation practice d by different people , based on their intrinsic nature.
[GITA:17851] Some completely ignore performing prescribed duties out of ignorance or
[GITA:17852] false knowledge. Such renunciation is tamasic (nescient). There are so me
[GITA:17853] who are aware of their prescribed duties but find excuses such as bodily
[GITA:17854] discomfort to avoid doing them. Their abandonment is rajasic and does not
[GITA:17855] earn the Lord’s grace. The sattvic consider their prescribed duties as an
[GITA:17856] obligation and perform them without attachment and expectations. Their
[GITA:17857] renunciation of attachment to activities and rewards is sattvic and is to be
[GITA:17858] followed by everyone.

[GITA:17883] A sattvic renouncer is one who neither despises unpl easant activities
[GITA:17884] nor craves for pleasant activities, one who offers all activities to the Lord,
[GITA:17885] one who is pious by nature, one who has understood the Lord, and one who
[GITA:17886] has no doubts about the nature of the Lord and the Universe. (18.10)
[GITA:17888] One with a physi cal body can never completely renounce all
[GITA:17889] activities (as even breathing is an activity). One who has relinquished the
[GITA:17890] fruits of labour is the ideal tyagi. (18.11)
[GITA:17892] Those who perform activities with expectations will experience
[GITA:17893] either pleasant, or unpleasa nt, or mixed rewards after they leave this world.
[GITA:17894] This does not apply to those who perform duties without expectations.
[GITA:17895] (18.12)
[GITA:17897] Comments: These three verses provide more details on the
[GITA:17898] characteristics of renunciation based on the nature and approach of  the
[GITA:17899] seeker.  As per Rayaru in GV, verse 18.10  identifies five characteristics of
[GITA:17900] a sattvic renunciant as one who (i) does not abandon prescribed duties that
[GITA:17901] may be momentarily unpleasant, (ii) does not crave for activities that may
[GITA:17902] be momentarily pleasant, ( iii) has a pious nature, (iv) has understood
[GITA:17903] properly the Lord’s prowess, and (v) has no doubts regarding the
[GITA:17904] distinction between the universe and the Lord Almighty. Verse 18.11
[GITA:17905] counters a position that some hold that a ren ouncer should forsake all
[GITA:17906] activities. This verse states that for a living being , it is impossible to
[GITA:17907] forsake all activities, as even breathing is a type of activity. An ideal
[GITA:17908] renouncer is one who forsakes the rewards from actions and  not actions
[GITA:17909] themselves. Verse 18.12  explains the distin ction between a seeker who
[GITA:17910] performs activit ies with expectations o f   rewards and one who performs
[GITA:17911] prescribed duties with no expectations. The former one experience s three
[GITA:17912] different types of destinations in afterlife: downfall, heavenly rewards, and
[GITA:17913] rebirth in this world (depending on the approach and nature of their
[GITA:17914] activities such as tamasic, sattvic, rajasic ). However, one who performs
[GITA:17915] prescribed duties forsaking rewards will not experience these types of
[GITA:17916] destinations. Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that tho se seekers who have
[GITA:17928] Chapter 18                                                                                                                                           385
[GITA:17930] achieved self -realization and do not have any obligations to perform
[GITA:17931] activities, will achieve higher bliss in salvation depending on the extent of
[GITA:17932] their activities.  As indicated in 18.2 , renunciation is the abandonment of
[GITA:17933] activities performed for the sake of desired outcomes, and relinquishment is
[GITA:17934] forsaking of fruits of any action. Superior seekers who have achieved
[GITA:17935] self-realization have both these ch aracteristics (renunciation and
[GITA:17936] relinquishment).

[GITA:17949] O Arjuna, Mighty Armed One! There are five pre -requisites for
[GITA:17950] completion of any activity as enumerated in the Sankhya scripture. Learn
[GITA:17951] them from Me. (18.13)
[GITA:17953] They are as follows - the place for conducting activity (such as body,
[GITA:17954] earth), the performer (human, divine), the apparatus (sense organs, fire),
[GITA:17955] resulting rituals (meditation, prayer) and divinity (the Lord ). (18.14)
[GITA:17957] Whatever activity one performs through the body or the mind or
[GITA:17958] speech, whether it is right or wrong, that activity will require  the above five
[GITA:17959] pre-requisites for completion. (18.15)
[GITA:17961] Comments: As performance of activities is mandatory for everyone,
[GITA:17962] it is important to understand the prerequisites for performing them. These
[GITA:17963] verses identify the five prerequisites for action. Sri Raya ru in GV clarifies
[GITA:17975] 386                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:17976] that these are as per the Sankhya scripture which was composed by the
[GITA:17977] Lord in the form of Kapila . Verse 18.14 identifies the five prerequisites ,
[GITA:17978] and verse 18.15 clarifies that these five prerequisites are essential for
[GITA:17979] performing any activity, be it physical, vocal, or mental.
[GITA:17981] The concept of prerequisites for activities can be illustrated with an
[GITA:17982] example. Let us take the case of a seeker practicing meditation ( dhyana).
[GITA:17983] Following are the five prerequisites –
[GITA:17985] (i)      place = physical body
[GITA:17986] (ii)      performer = living being (dependent performer)
[GITA:17987] (iii) apparatus = living being’s mind
[GITA:17988] (iv) resulting ritual = focusing the mind
[GITA:17989] (v)      divinity = Lord Almighty (who powers everyone’s actions).
[GITA:17991] For example , in the case of one cooking rice, these five aspects
[GITA:17992] are – place (kitchen), performer (cook), apparatus ( utensils, stove),
[GITA:17993] resulting ritual (rice), and divinity (Lord who powers this activity).

[GITA:18003] Hence the unwise one, who foolishly considers  self to be the sole
[GITA:18004] performer of any action, is indeed devoid of proper knowledge. (18.16)
[GITA:18006] One who is not under the delusion of being the sole performer and
[GITA:18007] has no expectation on the outcome of action, will not be termed a killer
[GITA:18008] even if that person has killed while performing prescribed duties. Such a
[GITA:18009] person is not tainted with any sin. (18.17)
[GITA:18021] Chapter 18                                                                                                                                           387
[GITA:18023] Comments: These two verses amplify t he need for one to be aware
[GITA:18024] of the concept of doership. As there are five clear prerequisites for the
[GITA:18025] creation of  any activity, no one should be under the delusion of sol e,
[GITA:18026] independent doership. Verse 18.17  goes a step further and states that a
[GITA:18027] seeker who is not under the delusion of independent doership and performs
[GITA:18028] prescribed activities with no expectations of rewards , will not be tainted by
[GITA:18029] any sin, even if that activity involve s destruction of population. This
[GITA:18030] statement can raise issues as to how one ca n be absolved of great sins that
[GITA:18031] normally accompany such destructive activities. Sri Rayaru in GV based on
[GITA:18032] Sri Madhwacharya’s GB and Sri Jaya Teertha’s PD  clarifies this concept
[GITA:18033] with concrete examples. Lord Rudra (who governs the act of universe’s
[GITA:18034] dissolution) and Lord Yama (the deity of death) are associated with
[GITA:18035] destruction. However, these deities perform these activities as directed by
[GITA:18036] the independent, omniscient Lord Almighty and have no delusion that they
[GITA:18037] are performing these on their own. Hence , they are not tainted by any sin.
[GITA:18038] However, deity Indra who kills Vrutasura , was tainted with some sin as his
[GITA:18039] actions were accompanied by ego.

[GITA:18046] The motivations for any activity are three-fold - knowledge about the
[GITA:18047] activity (jnana), effort (prayatna), and the performer of the activity (jeeva).
[GITA:18048] The three main pre -requisites for any activity are - the apparatus, the
[GITA:18049] resulting ritual, and the doer. (18.18)
[GITA:18051] Comments: This verse describes the concept of doership where the
[GITA:18052] motivations for performing any activity are indicated, along with the
[GITA:18053] prerequisites fo r such activities. While verse 18.14  described the five
[GITA:18054] prerequisites for performing any activity, these five are summarized into 3
[GITA:18055] types – the apparatus  (which combines the place of operation and the
[GITA:18056] material utilities) , the resulting ritual and the doer  (which combines the
[GITA:18068] 388                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:18069] independent doer and divinity , both referring to the Lord Almighty) . In
[GITA:18070] addition to the pr erequisites that are essential for one to perform any
[GITA:18071] activity, one also needs motivation to engage in that activity. This verse
[GITA:18072] identifies the 3 motivators as – knowledge about the activity to be
[GITA:18073] performed (jnana), effort  (prayatna) that one needs to put in and the
[GITA:18074] performer of the activity  (jeeva). The performer of the activity is the living
[GITA:18075] individual who acts based on the power granted by the Lord. The individual
[GITA:18076] being is not an independent doer but acts under the control and supervision
[GITA:18077] of the independent Lord. The concept of doership is ex plained in detail by
[GITA:18078] Rayaru in GV based on Sri Madhwacharya’s GB and GTN . This topic was
[GITA:18079] covered previously in comments for verse 5.14.
[GITA:18081] One of the questions that arises is about prescribed duties mandated
[GITA:18082] in the scr iptures. Do they apply to the Lord, individual souls, or inert
[GITA:18083] matter? Sri Rayaru in GV  explains that by the process of elimination, one
[GITA:18084] can conclude that prescribed duties apply only to individuals. This is
[GITA:18085] because inert matter cannot act, and the Lord Almighty has no obligation or
[GITA:18086] mandate to act  (verse 3.22). Now, one can question the feasibility of a
[GITA:18087] living being as a doer, while the real doer is described as the Lord
[GITA:18088] Almighty. Sri Rayaru clarifies that while the Lord is the independent doer ,
[GITA:18089] living beings are dependent doers. In this sense, the mandates prescribed in
[GITA:18090] the scriptures apply to living beings who can perform activities based on
[GITA:18091] the material strength and powers granted to them by the Lord.  If the Lord
[GITA:18092] as the independent doer is responsible for  all activities, what is the role of
[GITA:18093] living beings? Living beings have an intrinsic intent ( iccha) to achieve
[GITA:18094] salvation which leads them to make attempts (prayatna). By the grace of
[GITA:18095] the Lord, they are given the ability to perform actions. Hence, living bei ngs
[GITA:18096] are responsible for their actions.

[GITA:18116] the explanation with attention. (18.19)
[GITA:18118] Comments: After having described the prerequisites for actions and
[GITA:18119] the concepts of doership, the Lord provides  a detailed explanation on the
[GITA:18120] categories of the three aspects of action – knowledge, resulting activity, and
[GITA:18121] the doer. These aspects are influenced by the three qualities of nature,
[GITA:18122] namely sattv, rajas, and tamas. The Lord also states the scriptural basis for
[GITA:18123] this classification as Vedic Sankhya.

[GITA:18134] Comments: Sattvic knowledge is one which recognizes the same
[GITA:18135] Lord as being present in different entities in the universe, such as living

[GITA:18137] present) to indicate the Lord. Later, in verse 18.61 , the Lord explicitly
[GITA:18138] states that He is present in everyone’s hearts. Hence, the reference in this
[GITA:18139] verse to the entity residing in everyone , the Lord Almighty Himself. The
[GITA:18140] concept describe d in this verse  was also stated previously in 13.17 and

[GITA:18158] That knowledge which teaches that everyone and everything in the
[GITA:18159] Universe is different from each other and from the Lord but does not teach
[GITA:18160] about the supremacy of the Lord is rajasic. (18.21)
[GITA:18162] Comments: Those with rajasic knowledge are aware that everyone
[GITA:18163] (living beings) and everything (inert matter) in the universe are different
[GITA:18164] (pṛthak). However, they do not have firm conviction about the supremacy
[GITA:18165] of the Lord. This concept is implied using the word ‘ tu’ (meaning
[GITA:18166] ‘however’), since the other two components of the universe (living beings
[GITA:18167] and inert matter) were stated explicitly.

[GITA:18175] Comments: Sri Rayaru in GV based on Sri Madhwacharya’s GTN
[GITA:18176] and the Padma Purana, provides three interpretations for this verse based
[GITA:18177] on the different meanings for the word kṛtsna (complete). This word can
[GITA:18178] mean either the Lord Almighty or the world. Those with tamasic
[GITA:18179] knowledge:
[GITA:18181] (i)   believe in the identity of the individual soul and the Lord
[GITA:18182] (ii)  believe in the identity of the individual soul and the inert world
[GITA:18183] (iii) believe that the world arose from one individual soul, and hence
[GITA:18184] self-knowledge also implies knowledge about the entire universe

[GITA:18222] Comments: These three verses describe the types of activities based
[GITA:18223] on the influence of the three qualities o f nature, sattva, rajas , and tamas.
[GITA:18224] Sri Rayaru in GV , draws attention to verses mentioned in chapter 3 ( (3.30)
[GITA:18225] and (3.31) ), where the Lord had stated that those who perform activities
[GITA:18226] without expectations, only as an offering to  Him, will not be entangled by

[GITA:18261] One who performs activities without offering them to the Lord, who
[GITA:18262] is not strengthened by devotion to the Lord, who is egoistic, who acts with

[GITA:18267] Comments: These three verses describe the nature of doers who
[GITA:18268] perform activities under the influence of the three qualities of nature. Given
[GITA:18269] that the doers are of th ree types, it is und erstandable that the activities

[GITA:18312] (18.30)
[GITA:18314] O Partha! Not being able to discriminate between virtuous and sinful

[GITA:18318] O Partha! Intelligence covered by ignorance which considers

[GITA:18322] Comments: In these verses, the faculty of intelligence appears to be
[GITA:18323] performing the activ ities indicated. Sri Rayaru in GV  clarifies that
[GITA:18324] intelligence, being an inert faculty cannot act  independently. The activities
[GITA:18325] stated are performed by an individual w hose intelligence is either sattvic,
[GITA:18326] rajasic, or tamasic. When someone refers to a strong leader as a lion

[GITA:18388] O Superior among the Bharatas! Now listen to the three types of
[GITA:18389] happiness. That happiness which increases with practice, frees one from
[GITA:18390] distress, feels poisonous in the beginning and turns out to be nectar  like
[GITA:18391] towards the end, is sattvic. This is achieved through peace of mind and the
[GITA:18392] express grace of the Lord Almighty. (18.36) (18.37)
[GITA:18394] Comments: The p ursuit of unending happiness is every living
[GITA:18395] being’s goal. However, the type of happiness that one pursues is sha ped by
[GITA:18396] the influence of the three qualities of nature . In verse 18.37 , the phrase
[GITA:18397] ‘buddhiprasādajam’ seems to imply that sattvic happiness arises from
[GITA:18398] peace of mind.  The m ind is inert. How  can the inert mind result in
[GITA:18399] happiness? Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that this phrase is preceded by ‘atma’
[GITA:18400] (referring to the Lord Almighty). Hence the implication is that one can
[GITA:18401] experience sattvic happiness only by the Lord’s grace, which also leads to
[GITA:18402] peace of mind.

[GITA:18414] Happiness arising out of excessive sleep, lethargy, and forgetfulness,
[GITA:18415] which creates addiction from beginning to end is tamasic. (18.39)
[GITA:18417] Comments:  These two verses describe  rajasic and tamasic types of
[GITA:18418] happiness. Rajasic happiness is that which is experienced bodily through
[GITA:18419] the sense organs. This excludes the happiness one feels during deep sleep
[GITA:18420] (sushupti) as one does not have awareness  of sense objects in this state.
[GITA:18421] Examples of tamasic happiness are those experienced due to indulgence in

[GITA:18450] The word ‘ punah’ in this verse, indicat ing ‘and’ as per Sri Satyadhyana
[GITA:18451] Teertha’s GPC, implies additional aspects not expressly state d in this verse.
[GITA:18452] Sri Rayaru in GV based on Sri Madhwacharya’s GB and GTN  provides
[GITA:18453] details of these additional aspects such as the proportion of the three
[GITA:18454] qualities among living beings (humans, deities,  and demons alike). For
[GITA:18455] example, deities have a higher proportion of sattv. Sages have a mixture of
[GITA:18456] sattv and rajas. Ancestral deities ( pitrus) and heavenly musicians
[GITA:18457] (gandharvas) have a mixture of sattv and tamas. The issue of
[GITA:18458] categorization among  deities based on their innate nature was addressed

[GITA:18571] innate nature. (18.47)
[GITA:18573] O Son of Kunti! One should not avoid performing prescribed
[GITA:18574] activities, even if there are imperfections. Just like smoke covers fire, all
[GITA:18575] activities will have some imperfections. (18.48)
[GITA:18577] Comments: In these verses, the Lord stresses on the importance of
[GITA:18578] one focusing o n performing one ’s prescribed duties . The primary
[GITA:18579] motivation for the Lord’s sermon to Arjuna is to convince Arjuna that he
[GITA:18580] should engage in the just war to protect his citizens as that is his prescribed
[GITA:18581] duty. Everyone has a specific role to play in society. Performing prescribed
[GITA:18582] duties without expectations is the way for one to earn the Lord’s grace. The
[GITA:18583] Lord who owns everything in the universe has no expectations from
[GITA:18584] anyone. There are many situations where one  may not be able to perform
[GITA:18585] one’s prescribed duties  perfectly. The Lord in verse (18.47) states th at one
[GITA:18586] should never abandon one ’s prescribed duty . The Lord recognizes in verse
[GITA:18587] 18.48 that no activity is ever perfect, just like fire is covered by smoke . As
[GITA:18588] no one is perfect, no action can be perfect. Hence  one should not avoid
[GITA:18589] performing prescribed duties fearing imperfect ion. This concept was
[GITA:18590] previously stated in verse 3.35.

[GITA:18601] Comments: In verse 18.47, the Lord stated that one  should focus on

[GITA:18603] this verse, the Lord identifies the conviction that should accompany

[GITA:18616] performance of such duti es. Sri Rayaru in GV  clarifies that one can
[GITA:18617] overcome worldly desires ( asaktabuddhiḥ sarvatra ) by controlling one ’s
[GITA:18618] mind ( jitātmā). These are not independent actions but  have a causal
[GITA:18619] relationship (as sense control helps to overcome desires) . In verse 18.45 ,
[GITA:18620] the term siddhi was interpreted to mean moksha. In this verse, the word
[GITA:18621] naiṣkarmya is used which  also means moksha, and hence the word siddhi
[GITA:18622] here is interpreted as the means to achieve moksha. The means are
[GITA:18623] scriptural study, performing virtuous activities to exhaust prarabdha karma
[GITA:18624] (consequences from accumulated deeds from one’s prior births that must be
[GITA:18625] experienced) etc.

[GITA:18636] Comments: In the previous verse, the Lord had identified the
[GITA:18637] approach for a seeker to attain the states that would lead one to liberation.
[GITA:18638] This verse states that such a seeker would first reach Goddess
[GITA:18639] Mahalakshmi, who would then recommend  that the Lord should grant the
[GITA:18640] seeker liberation (moksha). Sri Rayaru in GV clarifies that ‘brahma’, in this
[GITA:18641] verse, refers to Goddess Mahalakshmi ( apara brahma) and n ot to the four
[GITA:18642] faced deity Brahma or the Lord ( para brahma). The meaning of ‘brahma’
[GITA:18643] is based on the context . The interpretation here is consistent with those in
[GITA:18644] verses 14.3, 14.27 and 18.54 . As this chapter is about renunciation and
[GITA:18645] liberation, the Lord d escribes the sequential steps for attaining liberation
[GITA:18646] (moksha) in detail. In verse 18.49 , it was stated that one must be rid of the
[GITA:18647] effects of all activities before being eligible to attain moksha. The next step
[GITA:18648] is to attain the abode of Mahalakshmi, and finally reach the abode of the
[GITA:18649] Lord (which is described in verses 18.55 to 18.57 ). Given this sequence of
[GITA:18661] Chapter 18                                                                                                                                           401
[GITA:18663] steps, it is also appropriate that Brahma  in this verse is interpreted to mean
[GITA:18664] Mahalakshmi.

[GITA:18676] avoiding crowded places, eating in moderation, focusing the mind and the
[GITA:18677] body on spiritual pursuits, m editating on the Lord, detaching from worldly
[GITA:18678] matters, overcoming ego, arrogance, greed, pride, lust, anger, and

[GITA:18681] Comments: As this final chapter is titled ‘ Liberation and
[GITA:18682] Renunciation’, in these verses, the Lord summar izes the characteristics of a
[GITA:18683] seeker eligible to achieve liberation. These verses consolidate and
[GITA:18684] summarize such characteristics which have been previously stated in many
[GITA:18685] chapters.
[GITA:18687] Sri Vidyamanya Teertha in GPM delineates the sequence of spiritual
[GITA:18688] progress based on these characteristics as follows . One who perfor ms
[GITA:18689] prescribed duties as per one ’s innate nature and abilities without
[GITA:18690] expectations will be able to achieve mental purity. This  helps the seeker in
[GITA:18691] controlling the mind and the sense organs. Detach ment from sense objects
[GITA:18692] helps one to overcome obsession and avarice. Such a seeker naturally
[GITA:18693] prefers to be alone and avoid crowded places. Consuming sattvic food in
[GITA:18694] moderation conditions the seeker to overcome emotions such as arrogance,
[GITA:18706] 402                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:18707] greed etc., and withdraw from unnecessary worldly happenings. The seeker
[GITA:18708] is now ready to focus the mind steadfastly on the Lord  and meditate. This
[GITA:18709] leads the seeker to develop deep devotion in the Lord and perform activities
[GITA:18710] without any material expectations.

[GITA:18759] that I am the Supreme One. Focus your mind on Me and follow the path of

[GITA:18762] Comments: In these three verses , the Lord indicates the reward for
[GITA:18763] His devotees. They will achieve liberation because  of their unflinching
[GITA:18764] devotion to Him. The Lord expressly states that one can achieve liberation
[GITA:18765] only through His grace. This indicates that while seekers choose many
[GITA:18766] different paths for self -realization, ultimately it is only through the Lord’s
[GITA:18767] grace (matprasādād) that one can achieve everlasting bliss.
[GITA:18769] Sri Rayaru in GV  explains the context for the use of the word
[GITA:18770] ‘matparaḥ’ in this verse. If performing Vedic rituals and submitting them
[GITA:18771] to the Lord can guarantee liberation, is it possible that trividyas (those who
[GITA:18772] only go by the superficial interpretations of the Vedas to propitiate other
[GITA:18773] deities) can also achieve moksha? The Lord answers by including a
[GITA:18774] qualifier in verse 18.57 , in the form of ‘ matparaḥ’ which indicates the
[GITA:18775] supremacy of the Lord Almighty. Hence, one must always have the
[GITA:18776] conviction in the supremacy of the Lord to achieve liberation.

[GITA:18799] If you focus your mind on Me, you will overcome obstacles through
[GITA:18800] My grace. If you ignore My words out of arrogance, you will perish.
[GITA:18801] (18.58)
[GITA:18803] Out of ego a nd a sense of independence  in activities, if you decide
[GITA:18804] that you will not wage this war, your resolve will be broken. It is by the
[GITA:18805] Lord’s will that you will engage in this war. (18.59)
[GITA:18807] O Son of Kunti! Out of your innate nature, bound by delusion
[GITA:18808] (resulting from attachment to near and dear ones) , if you try to avoid
[GITA:18809] performing your prescribed duty (of waging this just war), you will be
[GITA:18810] compelled to act even if you are not so inclined. (18.60)
[GITA:18812] Comments: After having described the philosophical principles
[GITA:18813] related to prescribed duties, the Lord now gets back to the issue at hand,
[GITA:18814] which is convincing Arjuna about the path forward. In these three verses,
[GITA:18815] the Lord instructs Arjuna on the perils of not performing one’s prescribed
[GITA:18816] duties. The Lord had stated that o ne who focuses on performing prescribed
[GITA:18817] duties will overcome obstacles through His grace. However, if Arjuna were
[GITA:18818] to ignore the Lord’s advice, he w ould experience downfall. The Lord goes
[GITA:18819] a step further and informs Arjuna that he would wage the war even if he
[GITA:18820] were not inclined to do so, as that was His will. Sri Vadiraja Teertha in
[GITA:18821] BGL provides another interpretation for the word ‘ avaśa’ in 18.60. This
[GITA:18822] word also means ‘one who is  under the control of the Lord’ (as ‘ a’ means
[GITA:18823] Lord and ‘vaśa’ means ‘under the control’). In this case, the context is that
[GITA:18824] Arjuna will end up waging the war under the control of the Lord Almighty
[GITA:18825] as that was His will.

[GITA:18846] Comments: In the previous verses the Lord stated that one achieves
[GITA:18847] liberation through His grace. In this verse , the Lord goes a step further and
[GITA:18848] states that He is present in the hearts of all living beings  and propels them
[GITA:18849] into action. The Lord uses the word ‘yantrā’ (machine) to describe  the
[GITA:18850] physical bodies of living beings. Just as a machine relies on an engine for
[GITA:18851] running, every physical body depends on its heart for proper functioning.
[GITA:18852] The Lord states that He resides in the hearts  of all living beings . This
[GITA:18853] concept was also discussed in verse 15.15 , where the Lord had state d that
[GITA:18854] He resides in everyone’s hearts.
[GITA:18856] Sri Vidyamanya Teertha in his GPM  states that this single verse can
[GITA:18857] be considered to contain the core principles of the entire Gita on the basis
[GITA:18858] of the logic  of ‘sthalee pulaka nyaya ’ (where one needs to examine only
[GITA:18859] one grain of rice to verify if the entire pot of rice is cooked).

[GITA:18870] Comments: As indicated in the previous verse, the independent
[GITA:18871] Lord causes everyone to act. Hence, it is important for one to get rid of ego
[GITA:18872] and surrender to the Lord. Sri Rayaru in GV states that ‘śāśvatam’ (eternal)
[GITA:18873] here refers to Vaikunta, the abode of the Lord which is embodied by
[GITA:18874] Goddess Mahalakshmi. Also, i n this verse, t he Lord uses third person to
[GITA:18875] indirectly refer to Himself. Sri Rayaru in GV based on Sri Madhwacharya’s
[GITA:18876] GTN states that the use of third person as opposed to using  the first person
[GITA:18877] clarifies the concepts much more forcefully.

[GITA:18901] Madhwacharya’s GTN states that this is a rhetorical direction from the
[GITA:18902] Lord and is not to be interpreted literally. The real pu rport of this direction
[GITA:18903] is to ask Arjuna if he will act against the Lord’s teachings even after
[GITA:18904] contemplating on them. This will be clear after a review of Arjuna’s
[GITA:18905] response in 18.73 where he states that he would act as per Krishna’s words
[GITA:18906] (kariṣye vacanaṁ tava) and not as per his own wishes.

[GITA:18919] has identified the characteristics of a devotee who is dear to Him. By

[GITA:18948] Comments: The Lord instructs Arjuna to worship only Him with the
[GITA:18949] four-way procedure – through the mind, through devotion, through
[GITA:18950] propitiation and through salutation. By using the word ‘satyaṁ’, the Lord is
[GITA:18951] assuring Arjuna that there should not be any doubt in his mind about him
[GITA:18952] achieving liberation.
[GITA:18954] Sri Madinur Vishnu Teertha in BGS  has identified this verse as
[GITA:18955] containing the essence of this entire chapter. Arjuna was asking for specifi c
[GITA:18956] directions from Krishna as he was indecisive about the war. In this verse,
[GITA:18957] the Lord specifically directs Arjuna to worship Him through the four -way
[GITA:18958] procedure and confirms that Arjuna would achieve moksha following this
[GITA:18959] path. Hence this verse can be consi dered as the core verse of this chapter
[GITA:18960] (which is known as moksha sanyasa yoga).

[GITA:18968] lament. (18.66)
[GITA:18970] Comments: This is a continuation of the previous verse where the
[GITA:18971] Lord had instructed Arjuna to engage in exclusive four-way worship of
[GITA:18972] Him. One should not interpret ‘sarvadharmān parityajya’ to mean that one
[GITA:18984] 408                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:18985] should renounce all activities. The Lord had instructed Arjuna many times
[GITA:18986] to focus on performing the prescribed duty of waging the war (verse s
[GITA:18987] (2.37), (4.42), (11.33)) . Also, Sri Madhwacharya in GB  reminds one that
[GITA:18988] the Lo rd Himself had stated in verse 18.11  that re nouncing activities
[GITA:18989] (tyaga)  mean relinquishing rewards from activities.
[GITA:18991] Sri Vidyesha Teertha in his book, Prana Tattva in the Gita [GPH],
[GITA:18992] provides an alternate interpretation for this verse based on the word
[GITA:18993] derivation of ‘māmekaṁ’ as ma + me + kam , where ma = do not; me = to
[GITA:18994] Me, ka = Vayudeva. In comments to verse 11.40 , it was indicated that the
[GITA:18995] word ‘sarva’ also refers to the Lord Almighty (based on the Lord’s
[GITA:18996] attribute of omnipresence) and this interpretation is supporte d by
[GITA:18997] Upanishads and Vishnu Sahasra Nama . Hence, sarva dharma  refers to
[GITA:18998] Dharmic activities related to the Lord. The reference to the deity Vayudeva
[GITA:18999] here is in recognition of his status as supreme among all living beings
[GITA:19000] (jivas). In comments to verse 1.31, Sri Rayaru in GV  interpreted the word
[GITA:19001] ‘keshava’, referring to Lord Krishna as one who controls even deities ‘ ka’
[GITA:19002] (Brahma, Vayudeva) and ‘ isha’ (Rudra). Now, w ith th e above word
[GITA:19003] derivation for ‘ māmekaṁ’, verse 18.66 can also be interpreted as
[GITA:19004] follows – “Do not renounce Dharmic activities (related to the Lord) ,
[GITA:19005] surrender to Vayudeva and Me. I will liberate you from all your sins and
[GITA:19006] grant you bliss. Do not lament”.

[GITA:19031] Comments: This verse identifies four characteristics of those who
[GITA:19032] are unsuitable for receiving the teachings of the Gita. Sri Rayaru in GV
[GITA:19033] provides an interesting interpretation for  the use of the word ‘ cā’ (which
[GITA:19034] means ‘and’) in this verse to relate these four characteristics. This word
[GITA:19035] implies progressive harm in teaching the Gita to such categories of people.
[GITA:19036] Teaching those who are not austere is harmful. Teaching those who do not
[GITA:19037] serve teachers/elders is more harmful than teaching those who are not
[GITA:19038] austere. Teaching those who are not devoted to the Lord is even more
[GITA:19039] harmful than teaching those who do not serve teachers/elders. Finally,
[GITA:19040] teaching those who have hatred towards the Lo rd is most harmful.  The use
[GITA:19041] of the word ‘ kadācana’ (meaning ‘never’) indicates that even if someone
[GITA:19042] were to preach the Gita to those who may not be sufficiently austere or
[GITA:19043] may not adequately serve their elders/teachers, it should never be taught to
[GITA:19044] those not devoted to the Lord.

[GITA:19078] and then teaching the Gita to the faithful. The Lord specifically identifies
[GITA:19079] those among humans (manuṣyeṣu) who are  dearest to Him. Sri Rayaru in
[GITA:19080] GV states that the intention of specifically identifying humans here  is to
[GITA:19081] clarify that the deities also impart the knowledge of the Gita and they will

[GITA:19151] Comments: In this verse Arjuna responds to Lord Krishna
[GITA:19152] enthusiastically by stating  that his delusion has dissipated, and he is now
[GITA:19153] firmly convinced about his duty of waging the war to protect his citizens.
[GITA:19154] There are three important points that must be noted here -
[GITA:19156] (i) The Lord had asked Arjuna in the previous verse if Arjuna  had
[GITA:19157] listened to His sermon with attention and got all his doubts removed.
[GITA:19169] 412                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:19170] Arjuna states that his doubts have been cleared because of the Lord’s grace
[GITA:19171] (tvatprasādāt). This implies that in addition to one 's effort, one needs the
[GITA:19172] Lord’s grace to succeed in any venture
[GITA:19174] (ii) Arjuna indicates that his sense of duty has been awakened. This
[GITA:19175] implies that Arjuna (who is an incarnation of deity Indra and  was well
[GITA:19176] versed in divine knowledge)  had knowledge  about his prescribed duties,
[GITA:19177] but that knowledge had been temporarily lost. Hence, he is stating that his
[GITA:19178] memory of divine knowledge has returned (smṛtir labdhā)
[GITA:19180] (iii) In verse 18.63, it was stated that the Lord’s concluding direction
[GITA:19181] to Arjuna stated in ‘yathecchasi tathā kuru’ was a rhetorical direction from
[GITA:19182] Him. It was by no means  granting Arjuna the freedom to do what he
[GITA:19183] wished. In this verse, A rjuna does not state that he would act as per his
[GITA:19184] wishes but that he would act as per the Lord’s words  - ‘kariṣye vacanaṁ
[GITA:19185] tava’. This confirms that the direction f rom Krishna to Arjuna in verse
[GITA:19186] 18.63 was indeed rhetorical.  Acting as per the Lord’s words is  the real
[GITA:19187] meaning of sharanagati (surrender) indicated in 18.66.

[GITA:19261] It is my  firm belief that wherever there is the presence of Lord
[GITA:19262] Krishna (the Lord of all Yogas) and Arjuna, the holder of the bow, there
[GITA:19263] will be abundance of wealth, victory, glory, and everlasting justice. (18.78)
[GITA:19265] Comments: Sensing Dhrutarashtra’s curiosity abo ut the side that
[GITA:19266] won the war, Sanjaya indirectly answers the king by stating that the side
[GITA:19267] that has Krishna and Arjuna will always be victorious.
[GITA:19269] This verse can also be interpreted to indicate victory for the side that
[GITA:19270] had the presence of Lord Krishna an d deity Vayudeva. HH Sri Vidyasagara
[GITA:19271] Madhava Teertha provides the following explanation  for interpreting this
[GITA:19272] verse as indicating primarily the presence of deity Vayudeva along with
[GITA:19273] Lord Krishna.  As the Gita is a direct teaching by Lord Krishna, only
[GITA:19274] Vayudeva (who is superior most among the individual souls) can
[GITA:19275] comprehend the teachings fully. Arjuna, who has an instance of Indra can
[GITA:19276] receive the teachings in the Gita only because of special powers granted to
[GITA:19277] him by Vayudeva. Sri Madhwacharya has stated in  MBTN, Chapter 12,
[GITA:19278] verse 129 that Vayudeva had a special presence in Arjuna in the form of
[GITA:19279] ‘Veera’. In a conversation between Hanuman (a direct of incarnation of
[GITA:19280] Vayudeva) and Bheema (another incarnation of Vayudeva) in  the
[GITA:19281] Mahabharata, Hanuman assures Bheem a that during the Mahabharata
[GITA:19282] war, he would be present on the flag of Arjuna’s chariot and destroy the
[GITA:19283] enemies by a mere roar. This is the reason for Arjuna being referred to as
[GITA:19284] ‘kapi dwaja’ (verse 1.20). This incident is narrated by Sri Madhwacharya
[GITA:19285] in MBTN, chapter 22, verse 288 . The phrase ‘yatra pārthodhanurdharaḥ’
[GITA:19286] in this verse can also be derived as ‘ yatra pārtho adhanurdhara ḥ’, where
[GITA:19287] partha (son of Kunti) can be a reference to Bheema and adhanurdharaḥ is
[GITA:19288] an adjective that can be applied to Bheema as one who can fight a war
[GITA:19289] without any weapon (as dhanus means weapon). Atharva Upanishat (4.5)
[GITA:19290] compares a bow to the primordial syllable Om (which is the root of all
[GITA:19291] knowledge), the arrow to the mind of a seeker and the Lord Almighty to the
[GITA:19292] target, imp lying that one must focus one ’s mind on the Lord using the
[GITA:19293] wisdom of the Vedas to reach Him. Sri Madhwacharya in  his commentary
[GITA:19294] on Taittireeya Upanishat , interprets Bheema as the holder of all Vedic
[GITA:19306] Chapter 18                                                                                                                                           415
[GITA:19308] knowledge and hence the word ‘ dhanurdharaḥ’ (holder of bow) can be
[GITA:19309] interpreted to mean Bheema [GPH]
[GITA:19311] Now, the verse 18.78  can also be interpreted as follows - It is my
[GITA:19312] firm belief that wherever there is the presence of Lord Krishna (the Lord of
[GITA:19313] all Yogas), and Vayudeva, there will be a bundance of wealth, victory,
[GITA:19314] glory, and everlasting justice.

[GITA:19335] Summary of Chapter 18
[GITA:19337] This chapter has 78 verses. The first 55 verses contain the
[GITA:19338] conversation between Arjuna and Krishna regarding clarifications on
[GITA:19339] concepts previously covered in other chapters. The Lor d concludes His
[GITA:19340] teaching in the next 17 verses. Arjuna thanks the Lord in the 73rd verse. The
[GITA:19341] last 5 verses have concluding remarks from Sanjaya. Arjuna begins by
[GITA:19353] 416                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:19354] asking Krishna what the difference between renunciation ( saṁnyāsa) and
[GITA:19355] relinquishment (tyāga) was, as both seem to imply the same. In verse (5.2),
[GITA:19356] it was stated that renunciation ( sanyāsa) was essential to attain liberation
[GITA:19357] (moksha), and in verse 12.12 , relinquishment ( tyāga) was lauded as a
[GITA:19358] superior means to attain liberation ( moksha). Arjuna wan ts to know about
[GITA:19359] relative merits of these two approaches. The Lord provides answers to
[GITA:19360] Arjuna’s questions with a detailed description of the various aspects of
[GITA:19361] renunciation and relinquishment in verses 18.2 to 18.12 . In chapter 5
[GITA:19362] (verses 14, 15) the concep t of doership of activities was briefly described.
[GITA:19363] This aspect is expa nded in this chapter in verses 18.13 to 18.18 . In chapter
[GITA:19364] 2, verse 45, it was stated that a seeker must strive to understand the inner
[GITA:19365] meanings of rituals indicated in the Vedas and not just accept the
[GITA:19366] superficial meaning. This point is elaborated in this chapter. In chapter 14,
[GITA:19367] the influence and impact of the three qualities  of nature on living beings
[GITA:19368] was discussed. In this chapter, additional aspects of the qualities of na ture
[GITA:19369] are elaborated in verses 18.19 to 18.39. Previously, in verse 4.13 , the Lord
[GITA:19370] identified the categorization of the society based on the innate nature and
[GITA:19371] activities of individuals. In this chapter, this c oncept is elaborated in verses
[GITA:19372] 18.40 to 18.48. Verses 18.49 to  18.55 provide details of the methods for
[GITA:19373] one to achieve salvation ( moksha), as that is the goa l of all living beings.
[GITA:19374] Verses 18.68 to 18.71  describes the glory of the Gita (more details on
[GITA:19375] Gita’s glory appears in Annexure 1). Sanjaya concludes his commentary on
[GITA:19376] the battleground to King Dhrutarashtra in verses 18.74 to 18.78  and
[GITA:19377] indirectly answers the King’s question about the side that won the war by
[GITA:19378] stating that the side that has Lord Krishna and  the warrior Arjuna will
[GITA:19379] always be victorious.

[GITA:19463] Summary: This passage which extols the virtues of the Gita is from the
[GITA:19464] epic Varaha Purana . Go ddess Dharadevi (the governing deity for earth)
[GITA:19465] asks Lord Vishnu how human beings (earth dwellers) can realize the Lord
[GITA:19466] when they are preoccupied with worldly afflictions . The Lord teaches her
[GITA:19467] about the glory of the Gita which helps human beings navigate the river of
[GITA:19478] Annexure 1                                                                                                                                419
[GITA:19481] worldly afflictions. The greatness of the Gita as stated by the Lord  can be
[GITA:19482] summarized as follows.
[GITA:19484] - Those who are engaged in the practice of reciting the Gita will not
[GITA:19485] be entangled by their actions.
[GITA:19486] - The place where one finds books on the Gita or ongoing lectures on
[GITA:19487] the Gita is said to be the home of all great, sacred rivers and
[GITA:19488] pilgrimage centers.
[GITA:19489] - It is also the place where great sages and yogis reside. The Lord also
[GITA:19490] resides there.
[GITA:19491] - The greatness of the Gita derives from the fact that  they are th e
[GITA:19492] words of the Lord Himself in the form of Krishna, who is full of
[GITA:19493] infinite auspicious attributes.
[GITA:19494] - One who recites and studies the Gita daily will attain liberation.
[GITA:19495] - One who utters the word ‘Gita’ at the time of leaving one’s body will
[GITA:19496] reach the Lord.
[GITA:19497] - Even those who have sinned will be rid of their sins if they have
[GITA:19498] read, analyze d, and underst ood the true meaning of the Gita. They
[GITA:19499] too achieve salvation.
[GITA:19500] - Great emperors such as Janaka reached higher destination s due to
[GITA:19501] their study of the Gita.
[GITA:19503] One must study  the glory of the Gita after completing the study of the
[GITA:19504] Gita for maximum benefit.

[GITA:19520] Annexure 2 – The Bhagavad Gita: Philosophical
[GITA:19521] Interpretation
[GITA:19523] The verses in the Gita have multiple meanings, each o f them being
[GITA:19524] consistent with the overall narrative. The first and the obvious
[GITA:19525] interpretation is based on the historical meaning of the verses. Another
[GITA:19526] subtle interpretation is based on the philosophical meaning of the verses.
[GITA:19527] Sri Madhwacharya places a lot of importance o n the philosophical aspects
[GITA:19528] of the Gita by stating in his Mahabharata Tatparya Nirnaya  (MBTN
[GITA:19529] 2.146) that the Mahabharata is not just a historical account of the lives of
[GITA:19530] the Pandavas and the Kauravas; it also is a deeply philosophical work .  Sri
[GITA:19531] Pangari Sreenivasacharya’s Gita Vivruti Adhyatma Artha  [GVAA] has
[GITA:19532] examples of multiple interpretations of the verses in the Gita.
[GITA:19534] It is said that the Bhagavad Gita is an embodiment of dharma (the
[GITA:19535] righteous way of living). This is further confirmed by  reviewing the first
[GITA:19536] letter of the first verse (1.1) – dhar and the  last letter of the last verse
[GITA:19537] 18.78 – ma. Thus, the Gita, which is encapsulated between the letters, dhar
[GITA:19538] and ma, is an embodiment of dharma.
[GITA:19540] To illustrate the philosophical interpretat ion of the Gita, Sri
[GITA:19541] Vidyasagara Madhava Teertha provides an interesting interpretation of the
[GITA:19542] first MTNP and last verses which is summarized below -
[GITA:19544] Y¥Vamï´> CdmM Ÿ-
[GITA:19545] Y_©joÌo Hw$éjoÌo g_doVm `w`wËgd… &
[GITA:19546] _m_H$m… nmÊS>dmü¡d {H$_Hw$d©V g§ÄO` Ÿ&& 1.1&&
[GITA:19548] The w ord dhṛtarāṣṭra is comprised of the words dhṛta and rāṣṭra,
[GITA:19549] where rāṣṭra = worldly miseries and dhṛta = the one bearing.  Hence, the
[GITA:19550] name dhṛtarāṣṭra represents a student, and indeed,  all of us who are
[GITA:19551] immersed in worldly afflictions. The name sañjaya is m ade up of root
[GITA:19552] words samyak and jayati (the one who has soundly conquered worldly
[GITA:19553] miseries) and represents a teacher who has overcome worldly miseries .
[GITA:19565] Annexure 2                                                                                                                                         421
[GITA:19567] Thus, this verse represents a conversation between a student and a teacher.
[GITA:19568] dharmakṣetra is based on the  word dharma (derived from the word
[GITA:19569] dharana, the one who protects, in other words the Lord Almighty).
[GITA:19570] kurukṣetra refers to kṣetra with the qualifier kuru which refers to the one
[GITA:19571] who is duty bound (as derived from the root word kru which indicates
[GITA:19572] action). Hence kurukṣetra can mean a person’s physical body. The word
[GITA:19573] māmakā is used by Dhrutarashtra to mean ‘my clan’ where ‘my’ signifies
[GITA:19574] ego which represents the demoni ac forces in our bod ies. In another
[GITA:19575] interpretation, the word ‘ ma’ represents knowledge and mamaka means
[GITA:19576] knowledge that is not evolved ( or ignorance). The word pāṇḍavā is derived
[GITA:19577] from root words  padi and gati which means moving towards knowledge ,
[GITA:19578] and hence is a representation of the angelic forces in our bodies  who
[GITA:19579] embody knowledge ( jnana). Thus, the Kauravas represent ignorance
[GITA:19580] (ajnana) and the Pandavas embody knowledge (jnana).
[GITA:19582] With these interpretations, the first verse can now be translated as
[GITA:19583] follows:
[GITA:19585] Dhrutarashtra (one who is enmeshed in worldly affliction) said -
[GITA:19587] O Sanjaya (the one who has soundly conquered worldly miseries)! In
[GITA:19588] Kurukshetra ( the physical body ) which houses dharmakṣetra (the Lord
[GITA:19589] Almighty), what was the outcome of the struggle (internal struggle)
[GITA:19590] between my clan (demoniac forces represented by ignorance) and the
[GITA:19591] Pandavas (angelic forces representing the knowledge)?
[GITA:19593] The central concept in the philosophical int erpretation of verse (1.1)
[GITA:19594] is about the internal struggle between the angelic and demoni ac forces and
[GITA:19595] its impact on one’s activities.
[GITA:19597] Now, the philosophical interpretation of the last verse follows -
[GITA:19599] `Ì `moJoœa… H¥$îUmo `Ì nmWm} YZwY©a… Ÿ&
[GITA:19600] VÌ lr{d©O`mo ^y{VY«w©dm Zr{V_©{V_©_ Ÿ&& 18. 78 &&

[GITA:19614] This verse is the concluding response by Sanjaya to King
[GITA:19615] Dhrutarashtra’s question in verse (1.1).  Here, Lord Krishna is described as
[GITA:19616] yogeśvaraḥ (the one who controls all paths and ways to achieve liberation)
[GITA:19617] since He has  described various paths such as karma yoga, jnana yoga,
[GITA:19618] dhyana yoga, and bhakti yoga for a seeker to achieve liberation. Arjuna, an
[GITA:19619] incarnation of the deity Indra with an  instance of the serpent deity Sesha
[GITA:19620] (nara) in him is knowledgeable about performing prescribed duties and
[GITA:19621] represents living beings. With these interpretations, verse 18.78 can now be
[GITA:19622] translated as follows -
[GITA:19624] All actions, where there is the presence of Lor d Almighty Krishna
[GITA:19625] (the Lord of all yogas), and Arjuna (a representative of all living beings),
[GITA:19626] will through the Lord’s grace result in great riches and success, eventually
[GITA:19627] leading to liberation.
[GITA:19629] In summary, the first verse posed a question about the outc ome of
[GITA:19630] the internal struggle between demoniac forces ( ignorance) and angelic
[GITA:19631] forces (knowledge) within all living beings , and the last verse answers by
[GITA:19632] stating that all actions where there is the presence of the Lord and Arjuna
[GITA:19633] (one who is aware of prescribed duties) will succeed fully.

[GITA:19648] Annexure 3 – The Bhagavad Gita and Dvaita Vedanta
[GITA:19650] Sri Madhwacharya, the great saint, and philosopher of the 12 th
[GITA:19651] century was a proponent of Dvaita Vedanta (philosophy of theistic dualism)
[GITA:19652] built on the foundational premise of the difference between individual souls
[GITA:19653] and the Supreme Soul (the Lord Almighty). Sri Madhwacharya has
[GITA:19654] composed over 37 works with seminal commentaries on the Gita, the
[GITA:19655] Vedas, the Upanishads, the Brahma Sutras , and epics such as the
[GITA:19656] Ramayana and the Mahabharata. In all his works, he quotes extensively
[GITA:19657] from these scriptures. In fact, his very first literary work was his
[GITA:19658] commentary on the Gita (Gita Bhashya). Sri Vyasa Teertha (16th century),
[GITA:19659] a great philosopher  and scholar from Sri Madhwa’s lineage has
[GITA:19660] summarized the philosophy of Sri Madhwacharya in a single verse,
[GITA:19661] popularly known as nava prameya  (the 9 tenets). In this section, the
[GITA:19662] relationship between these nine tenets and the teachings from the Gita are
[GITA:19663] described to emphasize the scriptural basis for Dvaita Vedanta.

[GITA:19672] The Nine Tenets of Sri Madhwa’s Philosophy
[GITA:19674] 1. Lord Sri Hari is the Supreme Being

[GITA:19676] 3. The differences (between the Lord, the individual souls, and inert
[GITA:19677] objects) are real
[GITA:19678] 4. Individual souls are under the control of Lord Sri Hari
[GITA:19679] 5. Individual souls have gradation in attributes
[GITA:19680] 6. Liberation is the ultimate experience of innate happiness
[GITA:19681] 7. Pure devotion to the Lord leads to liberation
[GITA:19693] 424                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:19694] 8. Direct knowledge, inference and scriptures are the evidence to
[GITA:19695] establish the truth
[GITA:19696] 9. The Lord is knowable through the Vedas
[GITA:19698] As will be  seen, these nine principles are woven throughout the
[GITA:19699] verses in the Gita. Following are some selected verses from the Gita to
[GITA:19700] establish their correspondence with these nine tenets.
[GITA:19702] 1. Supremacy of the Lord Almighty: Lord Sri Hari is the
[GITA:19703] Supreme Entity
[GITA:19705] (i) Verse 7.7: The Lord states mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiṁcid asti –
[GITA:19706] there is no entity in the universe that is superior to Me.
[GITA:19707] (ii) Verse 8.20 : The Lord states paras tasmāt tu bhāvonyo  – The
[GITA:19708] Lord is the entity that is independent, superior to and different from
[GITA:19709] everything in the universe.
[GITA:19710] (iii) Verse 15.16 : The Lord states uttamaḥ puruṣastvanyaḥ
[GITA:19711] paramātmety udāhṛtaḥ - the entity known as Paramatma is superior
[GITA:19712] to and different from all other entities.
[GITA:19713] (iv) Verse 11.43: Arjuna states na tvatsamosty abhyadhika ḥ kutonyo
[GITA:19714] – there is no o ne equal to You (Krishna) in this universe. How can
[GITA:19715] there be any one more superior?
[GITA:19717] 2. Realism of the world: The world is real
[GITA:19719] (i) Verse 9.10 : The Lord states mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ s ūyate
[GITA:19720] sacarācaram – under My direct supervision, Mother Nature creates
[GITA:19721] this world made of movable and immovable objects  (The Lord uses
[GITA:19722] the term ādhyakṣa which is derived from the word akṣa which means
[GITA:19723] seeing. The Lord physically oversees the process of creation of the
[GITA:19724] universe. As the Lord is real, so is the universe).
[GITA:19725] (ii) Verse 11.7: The Lord states ihaikastham jagat kṛtsnaṁ paśyādya
[GITA:19726] sacarācaram – look at the entire universe (jagat) situated in Me (The
[GITA:19727] Lord grants Arjuna divine  vision to view the entire universe within
[GITA:19728] Him).
[GITA:19739] Annexure 3                                                                                                                                      425
[GITA:19742] (iii) Verse 16.8 : The Lord states asatyam aprati ṣṭhaṁ te jagad āhur
[GITA:19743] anīśvaram. They say that the world is unreal and is not dependent on
[GITA:19744] the Lord Almighty  (The Lord describes the characteristics of those
[GITA:19745] with demoniac nature and states that they view the world ( jagat) as
[GITA:19746] unreal, thereby clarifying the principle of the reality of the world).
[GITA:19748] 3. The fivefold differences (Pancha Bheda) are real
[GITA:19750] The three entities in the universe, namely, the Lord Almighty, the
[GITA:19751] individual souls, and inert objects are different from one another.
[GITA:19752] (i) Verse 13.22 : puruṣaḥ prakṛtistho  hi bhu ṅkte prakṛtij ān gu ṇān.
[GITA:19753] Individual souls residing in the body, comprised of the elements of
[GITA:19754] nature, experience emotions through contact with the three attributes
[GITA:19755] of nature which are inert objects. This establishes the difference
[GITA:19756] between individual souls and inert objects.
[GITA:19757] (ii) Verse 13.31 : yadā bhūtap ṛthagbhāvam ekastham anupaśyati .
[GITA:19758] The same Lord resides in multitudes of different ( pṛthak) living
[GITA:19759] beings. The entire 17 th chapter is about the three types of intrinsic
[GITA:19760] faith in living beings as indicated by the Lord in verse (17.2) trividhā
[GITA:19761] bhavati śraddhā dehinā ṁ s ā svabhāvajā  - Living beings are
[GITA:19762] predisposed based on their innate nature into one of three qualities -
[GITA:19763] sattvic, rajasic or tamasic. This establishes the difference s among
[GITA:19764] individual souls.
[GITA:19765] (iii) Verses 13.6 and 13.7  enumerated the different components of
[GITA:19766] nature that impact an individual’s personality. This establishes the
[GITA:19767] differences  among inert objects.
[GITA:19768] (iv) Verse 7.4 : bhūmir āponalo vāyu ḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca|
[GITA:19769] ahaṁkāra itīya ṁ me bhinn ā pr akṛtir aṣṭadh ā||. The Lord states -
[GITA:19770] Earth, water, fire, wind, space, mind, intellect, and individuation are
[GITA:19771] the eight different parts of inert nature that are under My control.
[GITA:19772] This establishes the difference between the Lord and inert objects ,
[GITA:19773] and among inert objects.
[GITA:19774] (v) Verse 15.16 : The Lord states uttamaḥ puruṣastvanyaḥ
[GITA:19775] paramātmety udāhṛtaḥ - the entity known as Paramatma is superior
[GITA:19787] 426                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:19788] to and different from all other entities. This establishes the difference
[GITA:19789] between the Lord and individual souls.
[GITA:19791] 4. Individual souls are dependent on the Lord (they do not have
[GITA:19792] independent doership - kartṛtva)
[GITA:19794] (i) Verse 5.14 : The Lord states na kart ṛtvaṁ na karm āṇi – living
[GITA:19795] beings cannot act independently.
[GITA:19796] (ii) Verse 15.9 : The Lord states śrotraṁ cakṣuḥ sparśanaṁ ca
[GITA:19797] rasanaṁ ghrāṇam eva ca| adhiṣṭh āya manaś cāya ṁ viṣay ān
[GITA:19798] upasevate|| - The Lord resides in the sense organs - ears, eyes, skin,
[GITA:19799] tongue, nose, and mind and verily consumes the (righteous) objects
[GITA:19800] of sense pursuits. This clarifies that living beings are dependent on
[GITA:19801] the independent Lord Almighty.
[GITA:19802] (iii) Verse 18.61 : The Lord states īśvara ḥ sarvabh ūtānāṁ
[GITA:19803] hṛddeśerjuna tiṣṭhati|  bhrāmayan sarvabhūtāni yantrārū ḍhāni
[GITA:19804] māyayā|| - O Arjuna! The omnipotent Lord, residing in the hearts of
[GITA:19805] all living beings, propels them to perfo rm various activities through
[GITA:19806] His own free will. This further conf irms that living beings are
[GITA:19807] dependent on the independent Lord Almighty.
[GITA:19809] 5. Individual souls have gradations
[GITA:19811] Individual souls have different innate capabilities and eventually
[GITA:19812] attain different states.
[GITA:19813] (i) Verse 16.5 : The Lord states daivī sa ṁpad vimokṣ āya - Divine
[GITA:19814] nature paves the way for levels of liberation. vimokṣā is derived as
[GITA:19815] vividha + mokṣā, meaning different levels of bliss in liberation based
[GITA:19816] on the innate abilities (yogyata) and efforts (sadhana) of souls.
[GITA:19817] (ii) Verse 17.2: The Lord states trividhā bhavati śraddhā dehinā ṁ sā
[GITA:19818] svabhāvajā - Living beings are predisposed based on their innate
[GITA:19819] nature into one of three qualities - sattvic, rajasic or tamasic.
[GITA:19820] (iii) Verse 3.42: The Lord states indriyāṇi parāṇy āhur indriyebhyaḥ
[GITA:19821] paraṁ manaḥ| manasas tu parā buddhir yo buddheḥ paratas tu saḥ||
[GITA:19822] - It is said that the sense organs are superior, and the mind is more
[GITA:19833] Annexure 3                                                                                                                                      427
[GITA:19836] superior to them. The i ntellect is superior to the mind and ultimate
[GITA:19837] consciousness is even more superior to the intellect. Her e the entities
[GITA:19838] of the sense organs, the mind and the intellect refer to the respective
[GITA:19839] governing deities. This establishes gradation among the deities.
[GITA:19841] 6. Liberation is the ultimate state of innate happiness
[GITA:19843] (i) Verse 14.27 : The Lord states śāśvatasya ca dh armasya
[GITA:19844] sukhasyaikāntikasya ca. Moksha  is defined as the state of pure ,
[GITA:19845] unending bliss.
[GITA:19846] (ii) Verse 18.71 : The Lord states sopi mukta ḥ śubh āṁl lok ān
[GITA:19847] prāpnuyāt pu ṇyakarmaṇām – (the one who listens to our
[GITA:19848] conversations) will be liberated and will be in the wo rld of exalted,
[GITA:19849] virtuous souls.
[GITA:19851] 7. Pure devotion leads to liberation
[GITA:19853] (i) Verse 8.22  – The Lord states puruṣaḥ sa paraḥ p ārtha bhaktyā
[GITA:19854] labhyas tv ananyayā   - The Supreme One is reachable only by pure,
[GITA:19855] unadulterated devotion.
[GITA:19856] (ii) Verse 11.54  – the Lord state s bhaktyā tv ananyayā śakya aham
[GITA:19857] evaṁvidhorjuna - Only by single minded devotion can one
[GITA:19858] understand Me.
[GITA:19859] (iii) Verse 12.20 – the Lord states śraddadhānā matparamā bhaktās
[GITA:19860] tetīva me priyā ḥ - One who observes these methods sincerely, with
[GITA:19861] deep faith and devotion in Me, is indeed very dear to Me.
[GITA:19862] (iv) Verse 18.68  – the Lord states ya ima ṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ
[GITA:19863] madbhakteṣv abhidh āsyati| bhakti ṁ mayi par āṁ kṛtv ā mām
[GITA:19864] evaiṣyaty asaṁśayaḥ|| - One who imparts this highly secretive
[GITA:19865] knowledge to My devotees will develop deep devotion to Me and
[GITA:19866] will reach My abode. Let there not be any doubt in this.
[GITA:19867] (v) Verse 14.26  – The Lord states māṁ ca yovyabhic āreṇa
[GITA:19868] bhaktiyogena sevate| sa gu ṇān samatītyaitān brahmabhūyāya
[GITA:19869] kalpate|| - One who worships Me with pure, un alloyed devotion will
[GITA:19870] indeed be able to reach beyond the three qualities and attain the
[GITA:19882] 428                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
[GITA:19883] abode of Mother Nature - Goddess Mahalakshmi (which is also My
[GITA:19884] abode).
[GITA:19886] 8. The three types of evidence are the sources of knowledge
[GITA:19888] The methods of obtaining true knowledge constitute a fundam ental
[GITA:19889] part of epistemology. Sri Madhwacharya defines the means of
[GITA:19890] knowledge ( pramanas) as pratyaksha (sense perception), anumana
[GITA:19891] (inference) and agama (scriptural). Pratyaksha is the contact of a
[GITA:19892] defectless sense organ with a defectless object. Anumana is
[GITA:19893] defectless syllogism. Aagama is defectless verbal composition
[GITA:19894] (ex: Vedas).
[GITA:19896] (i) Verse 11.5 : The Lord states paśya me pārtha rūpā ṇi śataśotha
[GITA:19897] sahastraśaḥ| n ānāvidhāni divyāni nānāvar ṇākṛtīni ca||  The Lord
[GITA:19898] asks Arjuna to see His infinite forms. The Lord had given Arjuna
[GITA:19899] Divine Vision (which is defectless) with which Arjuna is able to see
[GITA:19900] the Lord (who is defectless). This is an example of pratyaksha
[GITA:19901] pramana.
[GITA:19902] (ii) Verse 7.7 : The Lord states mayi sarvam ida ṁ protaṁ s ūtre
[GITA:19903] maṇigaṇā iva - Everything in the unive rse is supported by Me, just
[GITA:19904] like a garland of pearls is supported by a string. When one sees a
[GITA:19905] garland of pearls, the string which holds the pearls together is
[GITA:19906] normally not visible. But one can infer the presence of the string as
[GITA:19907] the pearls cannot hold th emselves together. This is like inferring the
[GITA:19908] presence of fire on a hill just by watching the smoke from a distance,
[GITA:19909] as smoke will be visible only when there is fire. This is an example
[GITA:19910] of anumana pramana.
[GITA:19911] (iii) Verse 16.24 : The Lord states tasmāc chāstra ṁ pram āṇaṁ te
[GITA:19912] kāryākāryavyavasthitau - Therefore, scriptures are your guide in
[GITA:19913] performing right  deeds and avoiding wrong  deeds. The Lord states
[GITA:19914] that shastram (scriptures) are the pramanas (means) to understand
[GITA:19915] right and wrong deeds. This is an example of agama pramana.
[GITA:19928] Annexure 3                                                                                                                                      429
[GITA:19931] 9. The Lord is knowable through the Vedas
[GITA:19933] (i) Verse 7.8: The Lord states praṇavaḥ sarvavedeṣu - I am the
[GITA:19934] primordial syllable Om in the Vedas.
[GITA:19935] (ii) Verse 15.15: The Lord states vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyo  -
[GITA:19936] I am the one exclusively described in all Vedas.
[GITA:19937] (iii)) Verse (15.18): The Lord states atosmi loke vede ca prathita ḥ
[GITA:19938] puruṣottamaḥ - I am known as the Supreme Being and described as
[GITA:19939] such in scriptures that are composed (loka) and revealed (the Vedas).
[GITA:19951] 430                                                                                                                             The Bhagavad Gita
